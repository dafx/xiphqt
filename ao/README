OVERVIEW

Libao is a cross-platform audio library that allows programs to output
audio using a simple API on a wide variety of platforms.  It currently
supports:
   * Null output
   * WAV files
   * OSS (Open Sound System)
   * ESD (ESounD or Enlighten Sound Daemon)
   * ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture)
   * Solaris (untested)
   * IRIX (untested)

HISTORY

Libao began life as cross-platform audio library inside of ac3dec, an
AC3 decoder by Aaron Holtzman that is part of the LiViD project.  When
ogg123 (part of the command line vorbis tools) needed a way to play
audio on multiple operating systems, someone on the vorbis-dev mailing
list suggested the libao library as a possible way to add
cross-platform support to ogg123.  I (Stan Seibert) downloaded the
libao library, severely hacked it up in order to make the build
process simpler and support multiple live-playback devices.  (The
original code allowed one live playback driver, the wav driver, and a
null driver to be compiled into the library.)  

Then Jack Moffitt got it supporting dynamicly loaded plugins so that 
binary versions of libao could be provided.

This code is being maintained by Stan Seibert (indigo@aztec.asu.edu) 
and various other individuals.  Please DO NOT annoy Aaron Holtzman about 
bugs, features, comments, etc. regarding this code.
