- Committed some fixes from the Fink project to allow compiling on
  OS X (still with all the dlcompat stuff)
- Improvements in plugin detection code by David Walser, especially
  when ESD or aRts are present.
- NAS plugin from Antoine Mathys.
- Portability fixes for various platforms (including dlopen() bugs) 
  including HP-UX and *BSD.

- Significant fixes to ALSA 0.9.x plugin by Kevin Cody, Jr.  This
  should fix stuttering audio for mpg321 users.  The

  with some sound card drivers and also users of the dmix software mixer.
