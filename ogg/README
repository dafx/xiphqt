WHAT'S HERE:

This source distribution includes libogg and nothing else.  Other modules 
(eg, the modules vorbis, vorbis-tools and vorbis-plugins for the Vorbis 
codec) contain the codec libraries for use with Ogg bitstreams.

Directory:

./src  		The source for libogg, an LGPLed inplementation of 
		the public domain Ogg bitstream format

./include       Library API headers and codebooks

./debian        Rules/spec files for building Debian .deb packages

./doc           Ogg specification documents

./win32		Win32 projects and build automation

WHAT IS OGG?:

Ogg project codecs use the Ogg bitstream format to arrange the raw,
compressed bitstream into a more robust, useful form.  For example,
the Ogg bitstream makes seeking, time stamping and error recovery
possible, as well as mixing several sepearate, concurrent media
streams into a single physical bitstream.

CONTACT:

The Ogg homepage is located at 'http://www.xiph.org/ogg/'.
Up to date technical documents, contact information, source code and
pre-built utilities may be found there.

BUILD:

A standard build should consist of nothing more than:

./autogen.sh
make 

and as root if desired :

make install

This will install the Ogg libraries (static and shared) into
/usr/local/lib, includes into /usr/local/include and API manpages
(once we write some) into /usr/local/man.

BUILDING RPMS:

RPMs may be built by:

./autogen.sh
make dist
rpm -ta libogg-<version>.tar.gz

BUILDING ON WIN32:

Use the project file in the win32 directory.  It should compile out of the box.
You can also run one of the batch files from the commandline.

E.g.: build_ogg_dynamic
