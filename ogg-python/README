pyogg - a Python wrapper for the Ogg libraries

Ogg/Vorbis is available at http://www.xiph.org

There's not a whole lot you can do with this module by itself. You'll
probably also want the ogg.vorbis module, which can be found wherever
you got this.

You can now write Python programs to encode and decode Ogg Vorbis
files (encoding is quite a bit more involved). The module is
self-documenting, though I need to update quite a bit of it.

And if anyone is wondering why I have things separated into a main
module "ogg" and a submodule "ogg.vorbis", vorbis is the audio subset
of the ogg bitstream. In the future there will likely be a video part
of the ogg bistream, and nothing in the ogg modulue really has to know
about anything specific in the vorbis module.
 
To build, you need the distutils package, availible from
http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/download.html (it comes with
Python 2.0). Run "python setup.py build" to build and then as root run
"python setup.py install". You may need to run the config_unix.py
script, passing it a --prefix value if you've installed your ogg stuff
someplace weird. Alternately, you can just create a file called
"Setup" and put in values for ogg_include_dir, ogg_lib_dir, and
ogg_libs. The file format for Setup is:

key = value

with one pair per line.
