THEORA HARDWARE

================================================
DOCUMENTATION

doc/

 Here you will find some data about theora hardware and implementation

doc/leon3_integration

 This is the webpage that describe step by step the theora-hardware integration
 You can acess on http://www.students.ic.unicamp.br/~ra031198/theora_hardware/

================================================
LEON3 INTEGRATION

leon3/driver

  Linux driver for theora hardware

leon3/leon3_vhdl
  
  The VHDL modified files of LEON3

leon3/kernel_config

  Kernel versions that I am using is the linux-2.6.21.1 for MMU system

leon3/quartus_config_EP2S60

  Quartus configuration for FPGA ALTERA EP2s60 like pins locations and logiclock especifications

leon3/theora_amba_interface

  Hardware that is plug on AMBA/APB bus and do the interface between libtheora and theora_hardware

leon3/vga_amba_interface

  Hardware that is plug on AMBA/APB bus and is used with the full libtheora and just for show the video on monitor

leon3/libtheora_fpga/full

  Libtheora-1.0alpha6 that will send the datas to vga_amba_interface. If you want to use this on linux you need to do some changes, see on doc/leon3_integration

leon3/libtheora_fpga/cut

  Libtheora-1.0alpha6 that is cut to send the datas to theora hardware. If you want to use this on linux you need to do some changes, see on doc/leon3_integration

leon3/libtheora_fpga/ogg2inputvector.c

  It is used when you want to put the Theora on FPGA without a LINUX. It will generate a vector of inputs of a ogg file in order to compile this with the dump_video software

NIOS INTEGRATION

================================================
TESTBENCHS

testbenchs/expandblock
testbenchs/idctslow
testbenchs/include
testbenchs/loopfilter
testbenchs/reconrefframes
testbenchs/vga_controller

These are all the testbench of theora hardware

testbenchs/libtheora_tb

This is the libtheora that will generate the inputs and outputs (golden files) for the modules under test

================================================
THEORA HARDWARE VHDL MODULES

Here you can find the finals theora hardware modules
