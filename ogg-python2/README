Compiling
 Like most Python modules, compiling is done through Python:
  python config_unix.py
  python setup.py build
  python setup.py install (as root)

 It should be just that simple.  If you run into problems, let us know
 by entering a bug report at the url below.


Usage
 Inside Python, simply "import ogg2" like you would any module:
>>> import ogg2

 Before going any further, take a look at the docs and/or example
 scripts to see how the different parts of this module work together. 
 If you're brave and want to figure it out on your own, dir() should
 display the functions and attributes of any object in this module.


Bugs 
 No matter how much effort goes into debugging software, someone is
 eventually going to find another one.  Being as this is currently
 Alpha code, meaning it's still under development, there's sure to be
 bugs everywhere you turn.  To submit a bug report go to:
