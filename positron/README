---------------------------------------------------------------------

WARNING: This is a beta release of positron!  It may corrupt the
databases on your Neuros, requiring you to erase everything and start
over.  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.  (And make sure you look at the BACKING
UP THE DATABASE section.)


OVERVIEW

Positron is a synchronization tool for the Neuros portable music
player (http://www.neurosaudio.com).  Positron allows you to
individually add and delete tracks from a Neuros, as well as
synchronize it with a directory tree of music.

As far as your computer is concerned, a Neuros is just an external USB
1 hard disk, following the USB Mass Storage standard.  You can copy
any sort of file, music or otherwise, onto the Neuros.  However, only files
that are listed in a special database stored on the Neuros will be
playable.  This is where positron is needed.  It will both physically
copy files and update the Neuros database so those files are playable.


INSTALLATION

First, you need to install positron on your computer.  Untar the
positron source and cd into the "positron" directory.  Then run the
following commands:
[Insert weird python distutils commands here]

Next, you will need to configure your system to work with USB Mass
Storage devices.  The work required to do this varies depending upon
your particular distribution, but here are some general hints:

* You need kernel support for USB, USB Mass Storage, and SCSI drives
  either in the kernel or loaded as modules (usbcore, usb-storage,
  scsi_mod).  Some of these may automatically be loaded for you.

* Plug your Neuros into your USB port and wait a moment.  The "dmesg"
  command should show the Neuros being recognized by the USB subsystem
  and the assignment of a SCSI device (like "sda", for example).

* Create a directory to mount your Neuros under, like "/mnt/neuros"

* Now you can edit your /etc/fstab file and add a line like:

/dev/sda1 /mnt/neuros vfat user,noauto,umask=0	0 0

This is assuming that the Neuros was registered as "sda" when it was
discovered by the kernel.  You may have to adjust it.  The Neuros
filesystem, however, is always on partition 1.

* Test your setup by running "mount /mnt/neuros" as a normal user.
  You should be able to go browse around the contents of /mnt/neuros.
  (There will be something there, even if your Neuros is brand new and
  "empty".)

* Finally, run "positron config" while the Neuros is mounted and
  configure your personal settings.


BACKING UP THE DATABASE

Because positron is beta release software, it would be best to back up
the Neuros database before use.  You can do this by copying the entire
"WOID_DB" directory on the Neuros to some safe location.  If you need
to restore the database, just remove the "WOID_DB" directory on the
Neuros and copy your backup copy of the directory in its place.


USAGE

Before using positron, make sure to mount your Neuros.  And when you
are done, remember to unmount it before unplugging it.  Linux buffers
disk writes, and you want to make sure everything gets written to
disk.

Most people will use "positron sync" to copy over all of their music
directories (specified when you ran "positron config").  You can run
this command periodically, and only new tracks will be copied.

If you want to add a specific track, you can use "positron add track.mp3".

More detail on these commands can be found using "positron help".


IN CASE OF EMERGENCY

If for some reason your Neuros seems to be mysteriously locking up, or
your song listing seem incorrect or unusable, you can use "positron
rebuild" to recreate your database based upon the music files already
on the Neuros.  Positron will try to figure out where everything
should be filed, but with the following limitations:

* The pcaudio database will be cleared.
* All HiSi clips will be marked as unidentified, even if they had been
  previously identified.


CONTACT INFO

We strongly encourage bug reports and feature requests.  You can contact
us in one of the following ways:

* Bugzilla: http://bugs.xiph.org -- We strongly encourage bug reports
to be filed this way.
* Mailing list:

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Special thanks go out to:

  * Emmett Plant
  * Manuel Lora
  * Jack Moffitt

and most especially:
  * the awesome folks at Digital Innovations, who answered many
  questions, and were willing to open source positron.

Without valuable support from all these people, this software would not have
been possible.
