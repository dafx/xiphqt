<h1>Common Tasks</h1>

<p>
This section of the guide will help you get started using positron by
example.  It does not try to explain every command in positron, but
will guide you through common scenarios and show you how to use
positron in those cases.  See the <a href="commands.html">Command
Reference</a> for an exhaustive list of positron commands and options.
</p>

<p>
For all of these tasks, you must connect your Neuros to your computer
and mount it.  When you are finished and ready to disconnect the
Neuros, you must unmount it.  This is very important because Linux
buffers disk writes, and if you do not unmount before disconnecting,
it is possible to corrupt the Neuros database.  (See 
<a href="troubleshooting.html">Troubleshooting</a> for what to do 
if that happens.)
</p>

<h2>Adding Files</h2>

<p>
In this section, we will manually add files to the Neuros.  If you
want to add all your music and have positron automatically keep it up
to date, see the next section on "Synchronizing the Neuros."
</p>

<p>
To add a music track to the Neuros, just type:
<pre>
positron add my_music_track.mp3
</pre>

This will copy my_music_track.mp3 to the default music directory on the
Neuros (usually "MUSIC").
</p>

<p>
You can also add a whole directory of music files to the Neuros:
<pre>
positron add my_directory_of_music
</pre>

Positron will preserve the directory structure.  Don't worry if the
directory contains some files the Neuros can't play.  Positron checks
the contents of each file and will only copy it over recognized music
files (only MP3 at this point).  Additionally, positron will never
overwrite a file on the Neuros if it already exists.  You can use this
as a sort of "poor man's sync" by just adding the same directory
whenever its contents change.  Only new music files will be copied.
</p>

<p>
If you want to add some files and a directory and 
specify its destination on the Neuros, you can do that with:
<pre>
positron add sourcefile1.mp3 sourcefile2.mp3 anotherdir /mnt/neuros/tunes
</pre>

This will place a copy of <tt>sourcefile1.mp3</tt>,
<tt>sourcefile2.mp3</tt>, and <tt>anotherdir</tt> in
<tt>/mnt/neuros/tunes</tt>.
</p>

<h2>Synchronizing the Neuros</h2>

<p>
To synchronize your Neuros with your computer, first you need to 
<a href="config.html">configure your Neuros</a> and setup a syncpoint.
(Although you can always run this command without a syncpoint, it
won't do much without one.)  Once that is all set, all you have to do
is run:
<pre>
positron sync
</pre>
and that's it!  Positron will do several things now:
<ul>
  <li>Scan your syncpoints for new music files and copy them to the
   Neuros.</li>

  <li>Scan your Neuros for new recordings and copies them to your computer.
  (This step is skipped if you didn't specify a directory to copy them to
  during configuration.</li>

  <li>Remove unused space from your database if needed.  
   This is called "packing."</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
If you decide you don't want a particular Neuros recording on your
computer, you can delete it using <tt>rm</tt> or some other standard
file utility.  Positron remembers which recordings have been copied,
and won't copy them again.  Of course, you can always manually copy a
recording from the Neuros using <tt>cp</tt> or some other file
utility.  The Neuros stores recordings in the <tt>WOID_RECORD</tt>
subdirectory.
</p>

<p>
If you want positron to forget what recordings it has copied to your computer, use the command:
<pre>
positron sync --reset-recordings
</pre>
Similarly, you can get positron to forget what music files you have deleted (see next section) using
<pre>
positron sync --reset-deleted
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Removing Files</h2>

<p>
Sometimes you want to remove a music file from the Neuros.  You should
never, ever do this using normal file utilities.  They will remove the
file on disk, but not remove the database entry.  Your Neuros will
still show the track in its song list, but when you try to play it,
the behavior will be unpredictable.
</p>

<p>To remove a music track you can type something like:
<pre>
positron del /mnt/neuros/music/test.mp3
</pre>
Positron will both delete the file on the Neuros and remove the entry
from the database.  You can delete many files with one command, and
you can even delete whole directories of files!  Positron will never
delete files (regardless of type) that are not referenced in the
Neuros database, nor will it delete directories unless they are empty.
</p>

<p>
Positron will remember which files you have deleted and not recopy
them when you next synchronize.  This way you can remove files on your
Neuros that you don't want to listen to without having to remove them
from your syncpoint.  However, you can always manually add a track
using <tt>positron add</tt> whether or not it is in the list of
deleted tracks.  As mentioned above, you can clear the delete list
using:
<pre>
positron sync --reset-deleted
</pre>
</p>
