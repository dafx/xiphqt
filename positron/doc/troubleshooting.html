<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>

<p>
As you might expect, things can and will go wrong with technology.
This document will give some hints as to how to deal with problems.
</p>

<h2>Operating System Issues</h2>

<h3>Problem: I plug my Neuros in to my computer, but it is never
assigned a device.</h2>

<h3>Solution</h3>


<h2>Database Problems</h2>


<h2>If All Else Fails</h2>

<p>
If you can't seem to resolve a problem, you have a couple options:
</p>

<ul>
 
  <li>Report a bug - Use Bugzilla at http://bugs.xiph.org. We prefer bug
  reports to be filed this way.  Please file them against the 'positron'
  product.</li>

  <li>Ask on the mailing list - See http://www.xiph.org/archives.
  Look for the positron list.</li>

  <li>Find us on IRC - #positron on irc.xiph.org.</li>

  <li>Email the author - You may contact the author directly at <a
  href="mailto:volsung@xiph.org">volsung@xiph.org</a>, but please only
  do this as a last resort.</li>

</ul>
