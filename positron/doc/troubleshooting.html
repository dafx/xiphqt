<h1>Positron User's Guide: Troubleshooting</h1>

<p>
As you might expect, things can and will go wrong with technology.
This document will give some hints as to how to deal with problems.
</p>

<h2>Operating System Issues</h2>

<p>
A common problem is that you plug my Neuros in to my computer, but it is never
assigned a device.  There are several possible causes for this:
<ul class="biglist">

  <li>The <a href="install.html#reqmodules">required kernel
  modules</a> are not loaded.  Usually most of them are autoloaded,
  but there are some systems where <tt>usb-storage</tt> needs to be
  forced in by hand.  The 
  <a href="install.html#setupkernel">installation guide</a> gives some
  explanation of how to do this.</li> You can use <tt>lsmod</tt> to
  verify the modules are loaded and <tt>dmesg</tt> to see if there are
  any informative kernel messages.</li>

  <li>Some kernels just don't seem to work.  All the correct modules
  are loaded, but the usb modules just lock up when a Mass Storage
  device is attached.  This can even be a semi-random failure, like
  lockups during transfers.  Unfortunately, there is not much you
  can do in this case but upgrade your kernel.  The latest kernels
  (>= 2.4.20) seem to work well.</li>

  <li>The firmware on your Neuros might also contribute to this
  problem.  There have been reports that the 1.34 beta firmware causes
  periodic freezing in Linux during transfers.  If this is the
  firmware you are running, downgrading to the latest stable firmware
  might help.</li>

</ul>
</p>

<h2>Database Problems</h2>

<p>
Database problems frequently cause the unit to freeze while you are
using it, or they cause songs to be missing or misfiled.  This is
usually caused when the connection between the Neuros and the computer
is interrupted during transfer.  If the OS freezes, the Neuros
freezes, or the link cable is disconnected before you unmount the
device, the database can be corrupted.  To fix this, use the following command:
<pre>
positron rebuild
</pre>

This will reconstruct your databases from scratch based upon the music
files it finds on the Neuros.  If problems persist, there is a good
chance you found a bug in positron.  Please report it to us using one
of the <a href="#contact">methods</a> outlined below.  You will
probably want to zip up your <tt>WOID_DB</tt> subdirectory on the Neuros and
include it with the bug report.
</p>

<h2>Filesystem Problems</h2>

<p>
Another class of problems generates errors like:
<ul>
  <li>Input/Output errors (visible using the dmesg program)</li>
  <li>Linux thinks the filesystem is read-only.</li>
  <li>mount won't recognize the filesystem on your Neuros.</li>
  <li>Files on your Neuros have been damaged or destroyed.</li>
  <li>The Neuros freezes when playing certain files.</li>
</ul>
These symptoms suggest the filesystem on the Neuros has been corrupted
in some way.  Filesystem corruption is usually caused in the same way
as database corruption, though it is generally less common.
Unfortunately, the best way to fix a corrupted file system is to
format the Neuros and start over.
</p>

<p>
WARNING: The following operation erases the contents of your Neuros
and should only be attempted as a last resort.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Disconnect the USB cable between your Neuros and your computer.</li>

  <li>Turn off your Neuros.</li>

  <li>Press and hold the 1, 5, and Play buttons.  You should press the
   Play button slightly before the other two.</li>

  <li>When "SAFE MODE" menu appears, release the buttons and select 
  "Format Hard Disk" if you have the hard disk model or select 
  "Format NAND Disk" if you have the flash memory model.</li>

  <li>When the format finishes, select "Exit," and the Neuros will 
  continue its normal boot sequence, and tell you it is creating 
  databases.</li>

  <li>Connect your Neuros back to the USB port on your computer.
  Mount the disk, and run <tt>positron rebuild</tt>.  It is important
  that you do this immediately after formating because the Neuros
  firmware produces several incorrect databases after a format
  operation.  The <a href="commands.html#rebuild">rebuild</a> command
  corrects this problem.</li>

  <li>Your Neuros is now ready for normal use again.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Music File Detection Problems</h2>

<p>
While we've tested positron on a wide variety of MP3s, sometimes we
stumble across one that is not identified by positron, so it will
refuse to add it to the Neuros database.  Quite often, this is because
the file is corrupted in some way.  Many MP3 players are
<em>extremely</em> tolerant of damaged MP3s, so some of these files
are actually playable.  At this time, positron has no override switch
to allow you to force a file to be uploaded.  This may or may not be a
good thing because it is unclear how the Neuros firmware would handle
such damaged files.  Our suggestion is that you try to acquire the
file from another source or recreate it using a different tool.
Please contact us about problem files: we are interested in improving
our detection algorithm if it fails on legitimate files.
</p>

<h2 id="contact">If All Else Fails</h2>

<p>
If you can't seem to resolve a problem, you have a couple options:
</p>

<ul>
 
  <li>Report a bug - Use Bugzilla at http://bugs.xiph.org. We prefer bug
  reports to be filed this way.  Please file them against the 'positron'
  product.</li>

  <li>Ask on the mailing list - See http://www.xiph.org/archives.
  Look for the positron list.</li>

  <li>Find us on IRC - #positron on irc.xiph.org.</li>

  <li>Email the author - You may contact the author directly at <a
  href="mailto:volsung@xiph.org">volsung@xiph.org</a>, but please only
  do this as a last resort.</li>

</ul>
