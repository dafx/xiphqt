<h1>SAI File Format</h1>

<p>
This document explains the format of the SAI files.  SAI files are
used in the database as a table of contents.  Every non-deleted record
in the database will have a record in the SAI file.  SAI records are
all the same size, so it is very easy to modify the contents of this
file in place, including removing and reordering entries.
</p>

<p>
A record in a SAI file consists of a pointer to a MDB record, and to
its associated PAI module (if applicable).  The pointer to the PAI
module does not point to the start of the module, however, but to the
location of the <emph>first entry within the module</emph>.  See the
<a href="pai.html">PAI file format</a> for more information.
