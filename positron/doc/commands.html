<h1>Positron User's Guide: Command Reference</h1>

<h2>General</h2>

<p>
The general syntax for positron is:
<pre>
positron [-c config_dir] [-m mountpoint] [command] [command arguments]
</pre>

<dl class="option">

<dt>-m mountpoint, --mount-point=mountpoint</dt>
<dd>The directory where the Neuros is mounted.  This overrides
whatever is stoed in the configuration file.</dd>

<dt>-c config_dir, --config=config_dir</dt>
<dd>The directory where the positron configuration is stored.  By
default this is <tt>~/.positron</tt>.</dd>

</dl>
The commands are described below.
</p>

<h2 id="add">add</h2>

<p>
Adds files to the Neuros database, copying as necessary.  Files that
are already on the Neuros will not be overwritten, but just added to
the database if not already present.  Non-music files are ignored.
</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<dl class="option">
<dt>
positron add [sourcefile] [targetfile]
</dt>
<dd>
Copies sourcefile to targetfile (a path on the Neuros that does not exist)
</dd>

<dt>
positron add [sourcefile1] [sourcefile2] ... [targetdir]
</dt>
<dd>
Copies sourcefiles to targetdir (a directory on the Neuros that already
exists)
</dd>

<dt>
positron add [sourcefile1] [sourcefile2] ...
</dt>
<dd>
Copies sourcefiles to the default music directory.  Copy directories
to the default music directory the same way.
</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="del">del</h2>

<p>
Removes files both from the Neuros database and from the Neuros
filesystem.  Positron will only delete files that have database
entries, and will remove directories only if they are empty.  Positron
remembers which files have been deleted using this command, and will
not recopy them during <a href="#sync">synchronization</a>.  Deleted
files can be recopied using the <a href="#add">add</a> command.  The
list of deleted files can also be purged using the
<tt>--reset-deleted</tt> option to the <a href="#sync">sync</a>
command.
</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<dl class="option">
<dt>
positron del [files or directories]
</dt>
<dd>
Searches a list of files and/or directories on
the Neuros itself (ex: /mnt/neuros/music/rock) to be removed.
Directories will be recursively searched for music files to delete.
</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="clear">clear</h2>
<p>
Clears all entries from the databases.  This does not remove any
files, however.
</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<dl class="option">
<dt>
positron clear
</dt>
<dd>
Clears all databases.
</dd>

<dt>
positron clear [database1] [database2] ...
</dt>
<dd>
Clears all entries from a particular database.  Valid database names
are: audio, pcaudio, unidedhisi, idedhisi, failedhisi
</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="config">config</h2>
<p>
Creates or modifies the current configuration interactively.  Positron
will ask you a series of questions and create a configuration files
based upon your answers.  If you already have a configuration, those
options will be the default answers.  See the 
<a href="config.html">configuration guide</a> for more information.
</p>

<h2 id="help">help</h2>
<p>
Displays help information about positron commands.
</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<dl class="option">
<dt>
positron help
</dt>
<dd>
Shows general help about positron and a brief listing of commands.
</dd>

<dt>
positron help [command]
</dt>
<dd>
Displays detailed help about a specific command.
</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="list">list</h2>

<p>
Lists all of the entries in a database.  Only listing the audio
database is supported at this time.
</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<dl class="option">
<dt>
positron list
</dt>
<dd>
Lists entries in the audio database
</dd>

<dt>
positron list [database1] [database2] ...
</dt>
<dd>
List all entries from a particular database.  Valid database names
are: audio, pcaudio, unidedhisi, idedhisi, failedhisi
</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="pack">pack</h2>

<p>
Removes unused space from databases.  This is created when entries are
deleted from the database.  Note that packing is automatically done
whenever you <a href="#sync">synchronize</a> with positron, so you
should seldom need to do this manually.
</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<dl class="option">
<dt>
positron pack
</dt>
<dd>
Packs all databases.
</dd>

<dt>
positron pack [database1] [database2] ...
</dt>
<dd>
Packs all entries from a particular database.  Valid database names
are: audio, pcaudio, unidedhisi, idedhisi, failedhisi
</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="rebuild">rebuild</h2>

<p>
Recreates the Positron databases from the music tracks found on the
Neuros.  This command completed wipes the Neuros databases and
rebuilds them from scratch.  It is needed if your databases have
become corrupted.  Positron will locate all of the music files already
on the Neuros and put their entries back into the database as best as
it can guess.  The database of music stored on your computer
("pcaudio") will cleared and all HiSi clips will be marked as
unidentified even if they had been previously identified.
</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<dl class="option">
<dt>
positron rebuild
</dt>
<dd>
Rebuilds all of the databases.
</dd>
</dl

<h2 id="sync">sync</h2>

<p>
Synchronizes your Neuros with your music library.  This will scan all
of the syncpoints specified during <a
href="config.html">configuration</a> for new files and copy them to
your Neuros.  It also scans your Neuros for new FM, microphone or
line-in recordings and copies them to your, if you specified a
location for them during configuration.
</p>

<p>
Positron remembers which files have been removed with <tt>positron
del</tt> and which recordings have already been copied to the
computer.  They will not be recopied.  You can clear these lists with the options shown below.
</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<dl class="option">
<dt>
positron sync
</dt>
<dl>
Synchronizes Neuros with your computer.
</dl>

<dt>
positron sync --reset-deleted
</dt>

<dd>
Clears the list of deleted tracks.  This does not perform
synchronization.  Rerun <tt>sync</tt> without options to
synchronize.
</dd>

<dt>
positron sync --reset-recordings
</dt>

<dd>
Clears the list of recordings that have already by copied to the
computer.  This does not perform synchronization.  Rerun <tt>sync</tt>
without options to synchronize.
</dd>
</dl>
