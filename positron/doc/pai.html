<h1>PAI File Format</h1>

<p>
This document explains the format of the PAI files.  PAI files are
used in child databases to index the parent database.  Each child
database has a PAI file containing one module for each record, deleted
or not.  The module contains an entry for each record in the parent
database that has an access key corresponding to the record in the
child database.  For example, the "Rock" record in the Genre child
database has an associated PAI module, which contains entries for each
song in the parent database in the "Rock" genre.  This allows the
Neuros to quickly display all of the tracks in a particular category
quickly.
</p>

<p>
A record in a SAI file consists of a pointer to a MDB record, and to
its associated PAI module (if applicable).  The pointer to the PAI
module does not point to the start of the module, however, but to the
location of the <emph>first entry within the module</emph>.  See the
<a href="pai.html">PAI file format</a> for more information.
