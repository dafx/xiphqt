<h1>Positron Developer's Guide: An Overview of the Neuros</h1>

<p>
This document describes the design and features of the Neuros from a
developer's perspective.  It is not meant to be comprehensive, but
rather it covers the aspects of the Neuros most likely to be of
interest to someone writing software for it.
</p>

<h2>General Design</h2>

<p>
The Neuros is a portable music player designed to play compressed
music formats, like MP3 and Ogg Vorbis, as well as FM radio.  It can
also record to MP3 from either a microphone source or the radio.  A
modest FM transmitter also allows the Neuros to broadcast audio to a
nearby FM radio, thereby allowing cordless playback to things like car
radios and home stereo systems.  The "HiSi" feature allows a 30 second
clip from a song on the radio to be recorded in MP3 format and later
identified when the Neuros is attached to the host computer.
</p>

<p>
The Neuros itself is a modular device composed of both a main unit,
containing the DSP, flash memory and other electronics, and a backpack
containing the battery and optionally a hard disk.  This allows the
device to be upgraded by replacing the backpack to provide new
capabilities.  Currently, the Neuros is available in the following
configurations:

<ul>

    <li>128 MB - The main unit has 128 MB of flash, and the backpack
    only contains a battery.</li>

    <li>20 GB - The main unit has 64 MB of flash, and the backpack
    contains a battery and a 20 GB hard disk.</li>

</ul>

The HD backpack is sold separately, and can be attached to the 128 MB
main unit.  All configurations are handled the same way by the
synchronization software, with one exception documented in the <a
href="#pathformat">File Structure</a> section.  Note that the current
configuration of the Neuros cannot be straightforwardly detected in
software.  Positron decides whether the HD or the flash memory is in
use by looking at the size of the filesystem of the mounted Neuros.
</p>

<h2>Interface</h2>

<p>
All interfacing to the Neuros is done through a USB 1.1 port.  It
presents itself as a USB Mass Storage device, so the standard USB
drivers included with nearly all modern operating systems are used to
communicate with the Neuros.  The Neuros can then treated as an
external drive with a single FAT32 partition to be mounted using the
standard operating system tools.  Beyond that, no special drivers are
needed, which makes the Neuros (in principle) very portable between
operating systems.
</p>

<p>
When connected to a host computer via the USB port, the Neuros goes
into a synchronization mode where it simply acts as a passive hard
disk.  The host does not directly send commands the Neuros, but rather
copies files and manipulates a database stored on the filesystem,
which is then read by the device firmware when the device is
disconnected for normal use.
</p>

<h2>Database</h2>

<p>
Because the Neuros appears as a standard external hard drive when
attached to the host computer, any type of file can be stored on it,
regardless of whether it is a recognized audio file format.  Rather
than spend extra time dynamically generating a list of available music
files, a database of music files is maintained on the device.  Only
those files listed in the database will be made available for
playback.  The database also provides the ability to index files based
upon the contents of various fields in the database, like artist or
genre.  It is the job of the synchronization program running on the
host computer to update the database to reflect changes in the list of
files available for playback.
</p>

<p>
There are several databases kept on the Neuros.  One lists all the
audio files, but others are used to keep track of HiSi clips which
have been successfully identified, cannot be identified, or have not
been identified yet, as well as the listing of all the music files
stored on the host computer.
</p>

</p>

<h2>File Structure</h2>

<p>The file structure of the device is:</p>
<pre>
/        - root directory
/sn.txt  - contains the serial number of this Neuros
/WOID_DB/ - directory for all databases
/WOID_DB/audio/ - database of audio files stored on the Neuros
/WOID_DB/failedhisi/ - database of HiSi clips that could not be identified
/WOID_DB/idedhisi/ - database of HiSi clips that were identified
/WOID_DB/pcaudio/ - database of audio files stored on the host computer
/WOID_DB/unidedhisi/ - database of HiSi clips that have not been identified yet
/WOID_SYNC/ - not sure what this is for
/WOID_HISI/ - (Optional) directory for HiSi MP3 clips
/WOID_RECORD/ - (Optional) directory for recordings (FM or Microphone)
</pre>
<p>Also note that the Windows Neuros Sync Manager and positron use
<tt>/MUSIC/</tt> by default for storing music tracks, though that is
in no way required.</p>

<a name="pathformat"/>
<p>
Pathnames in the databases use a strange hybrid Windows/Unix-like
syntax.  The root directory on the Neuros is called "C:" if the Neuros
is wearing the hard drive backpack, and "D:" if the flash memory is
being used.  Forward slashes are used instead of backslashes.  For
example, <tt>C:/WOID_RECORD/Mic 02-27-01 17-19-00.mp3</tt> is a
possible filename for a track saved on the Neuros hard drive.
