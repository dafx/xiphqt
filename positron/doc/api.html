<h1>Positron Developer's Guide: Positron API</h1>

<p>
One of the goals of positron is to provide Python modules that can be
used by others to interact with the Neuros.  For this initial release,
however, we still consider the module API in a state of flux.  A
future release will include a finalized API.
