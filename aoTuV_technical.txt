aoTuV beta3 technical information

The differences from the aoTuV beta 2 and Vorbis 1.1...



  1. Dynamic impulse block noise control(q0-10). [32/44.1/48kHz only] 
  Conspicuous pre-echo is reduced.

  2. New ATH curve. 

  3. In order to cancel that a small sound becomes unstable, the noise level
  of low frequency is lowered under specific conditions. (Only below q3) 
  There is a greatest effect on a piano etc. [32/44.1/48kHz only]

  4. The rate of lossless stereo is increased in specific conditions. This
  improves many of conspicuous problems which a point stereo causes. (e.g 
  drumus's hiss/voice, guitar and brass's distortion) [32/44.1/48kHz only]

  5. The action of the noise normalization of point stereo is corrected. It
  was set to one of the causes of distortion in a long tone (e.g 
  strings/oboe/high tone voice). 

  6. The HF reduction code was not working normally. This is corrected and
  it retuned up according to the present condition. [32/44.1/48kHz only]

  7. The q-2 mode was added in all sampling frequencies. And nominal bitrate
  of q-1 are changed into a more nearly average value. Although nominal 
  bitrate is more large at a low sampling frequency, average bitrate hardly
  differs from the former version. 


...and I mainly tune up tone/noise masking parameters.
