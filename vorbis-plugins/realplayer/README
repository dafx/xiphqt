You'll need the RMA SDK to compile these.  You can find it at
www.realnetworks.com in the DevZone.

These currently work but don't support chaining or seeking.  Also
only stereo 44.1kHz files are supported.

Streaming doesn't seem to work but should soon.

Since the RMA SDK is hard to find at realnetworks.com, you can find it here:
http://proforma.real.com/rn/misc/g2sdk/

You can find RealPlayer8 at www.real.com or www.realnetworks.com, although
this plugin should work any g2 player i think.
