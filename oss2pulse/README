[Modified from the oss2jack README written by Kor]

This is an initial release and thus there is currently no
configuration.  This creates a single OSS device that connects to the
default Pulse source/sink. For now, just make sure pulseaudio is
running, ALSA OSS emulation is *not* installed, and then run oss2pulse.

oss2pulse creates the dynamic device node /dev/dsp, the mixer device
/dev/mixer and /de/sndstat.  Make sure, ALSA OSS emulation (or a real
OSS install) has not already created these devices.  Or, use the -n
command line argument to create an OSS device on an usused number (ie,
/dev/dspN)

Requirements:

  - Pulse Audio server
  - a 2.6 kernel with udev
  - kfusd (updated version from xiph.org)
  - udevd rule for fusd: 
	SUBSYSTEM=="fusd", NAME="fusd/%k"
