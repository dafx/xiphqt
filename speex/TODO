Version 1.0
Allocator override
better error handling

Version 1.2:
Allocator override (speex_lib_ctl)
support alloca?
better error handling



Features
-Add maximum/minimum bit-rate control for VBR
-Get the encoder to use the rate of packet loss (more conservative pitch gains)
-Improve error handling (with perror-like call?)

Long-term quality improvements
-Improve perceptual enhancement (including wideband)

Standards
-Complete Speex RTP profile
-MIME type registration

ideas:
Peelable stream (double codebook, higher bands, stereo)
LPC from spectral domain
Better psycho-acoustic model. Masking curve from Vorbis?
