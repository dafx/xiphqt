<h1> Speex: Free Voice Coding</h1>
   </center>
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/speex">The Speex project</a>
 aims  to build an open-source patent-free voice codec. Unlike other codecs 
like  MP3 and <a href="http://www.vorbis.org/">Ogg Vorbis</a>, Speex is specially 
 designed for compressing voice at low bit-rates for applications such as 
voice over IP (VoIP). In some sense, it is meant to be complementary to the 
Ogg Vorbis codec.    
<p>If you are interested in participating to the project, contact us at <a href="mailto:speex-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">
  speex-devel@lists.sourceforge.net</a>  or <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/speex-devel">
  join  our mailing list</a>. Right now, we are mostly looking for developers
 with signal processing and speech coding knowledge, as well as people with
 knowledge about patents in that field.<br>

<h2>News</h2>
   
<h3>2002/03/27</h3>
  Speex 0.0.1 has been released. This first version of Speex supports fixed
 bit-rate encoding at 14.5 kbps for speech sampled at 8 kHz (narrowband)
and  at 28.5 kbps for 16 kHz (wideband) speech. Future releases will likely
provide  a wider choice of bit-rates, better quality, as well as variable
bit-rate  (VBR) and discontinuous transmission (DTX).<br>
  <br>
  Note that this is a preliminary release and that bit-rates, quality and 
bitstream definition will change in the future. This means that the format 
used in this release will not be compatible with future releases. Also note 
that this software has so far recieved only a minimum amount of testing, so
it may break or do unexpected things.<br>

<h3>2002/03/12</h3>
  We now have a working encoder prototype that produces good quality narrowband 
 (8 kHz sampling rate) at a bit-rate of 14.5 kb/s. There is still a lot to 
 do, but we're progressing fast. You can download a snapshot of the current 
 code <a href="file:///Speex-0.0.0.tar.gz">here</a>.<br>
