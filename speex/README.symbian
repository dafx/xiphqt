Using Speex on Symbian OS
Conrad Parker and Colin Ward, CSIRO Australia, July 2004


Introduction
------------

Some minor modifications to libspeex and applications using the libspeex API
are required due to the following limitation imposed on DLLs in Symbian OS:

    The Symbian OS architecture does not allow DLLs to have a data
    segment (initialised or uninitialised). 

    -- Coding Idioms for Symbian OS, Oct 2002 [1]

This file (README.symbian) outlines how to build libspeex for Symbian OS,
and how to develop applications using the modified libspeex API.

Note that these modifications have been implemented in a portable manner so
that they may also be used on other platforms with similar restrictions,
and may be safely tested on more forgiving platforms such as Unix/Linux.


libspeex build modifications
----------------------------

The modifications required for libspeex on Symbian OS are fully contained in
the file libspeex/modes_noglobals.c. This file should be built instead of
libspeex/modes.c.

Additionally, the header file include/speex/speex_noglobals.h should be
installed into the system include directory, along with the other
speex_* headers.

When building in a GNU environment, this behaviour can be configured by:

  ./configure --disable-global-pointers

The symbian/ directory contains the following files for Symbian's abuild tool:

  bld.inf    Component definition file
  speex.mmp  Project specification file
  config.h   Configuration options for both emulator and device builds


Developing applications for libspeex modified for Symbian OS
------------------------------------------------------------

The only part of the libspeex API which has been modified for Symbian OS,
and thus affects user code which links against libspeex, is the removal of
statically defined SpeexMode structures: speex_nb_mode, speex_wb_mode,
speex_uwb_mode, and the array speex_mode_list[]. All other aspects of
application development using the libspeex API remain unchanged.


  1. applications must additionally include the header:

+    #include <speex_noglobals.h>


  2. any references to the statically defined SpeexMode structures must be
     replaced by a call to a constructor for that mode; and the
     constructed mode must later be free'd appropriately.

     * References to the statically defined array speex_mode_list[modeID]
     must be replaced by a call to speex_mode_new_byID (modeID):

-      mode = speex_mode_list[modeID];
+      mode = speex_mode_new_byID (modeID);

     and later free'd:

+      speex_mode_free_byID (mode, modeID);

     note that you must remember the association between a constructed
     mode and its modeID in order to correctly free it later. Failure to
     do so may introduce memory leaks or runtime errors.

     * References to the statically defined mode structures must be replaced:

       SpeexMode * mode1, * mode2, * mode3;

-      mode1 = &speex_nb_mode;
+      mode1 = speex_nb_mode_new ();

-      mode2 = &speex_wb_mode;
+      mode2 = speex_wb_mode_new ();

-      mode3 = &speex_uwb_mode;
+      mode3 = speex_uwb_mode_new ();

     Constructed modes must be free'd after use:

+      speex_nb_mode_free (mode1);
+      speex_wb_mode_free (mode2);
+      speex_uwb_mode_free (mode3);


  3. It is fairly easy to conditionally build an application for either
     usage of the libspeex API. For example using GNU Autoconf, you can
     check for the existence of a symbol such as speex_mode_new_byID in
     configure.ac. The following example is from libfishsound[2]:

    dnl Test for libspeex SPEEX_DISABLE_GLOBAL_POINTERS API
    dnl If so, we need to use a different API to access available modes,
    dnl and free them after use.
    AC_CHECK_LIB(speex, speex_mode_new_byID, DISABLE_GLOBAL_POINTERS="yes",
      DISABLE_GLOBAL_POINTERS="no")
    if test "x$DISABLE_GLOBAL_POINTERS" = xyes ; then
      AC_DEFINE(SPEEX_DISABLE_GLOBAL_POINTERS, ,
       [Define if libspeex uses SPEEX_DISABLE_GLOBAL_POINTERS API])
    fi
