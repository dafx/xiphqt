Introduction to Speex
\layout Standard

Speex has been designed with the following goals in mind:
\layout Itemize

Patent-free (imples that we can't use ACELP or other patented algorithms)
\layout Itemize

Good for Voice over IP (VoIP)
\layout Itemize

Provide with very good quality speech (at least as an option)
\layout Itemize

Allow a wide range of quality/bit-rate
\layout Itemize

Integrate both narrowband and wideband coding
\layout Itemize

Reasonable complexity
\layout Standard

Throughout the design the following assumptions and constraints were considered
\layout Itemize

Presence of packet losses
\layout Itemize

Integrity of received frames (no bit-errors)
\layout Itemize

Memory footprint is neither critical nor unlimited
\layout Standard

This led us to choose the CELP technique for Speex.
 Also many design decisions were based on the original goals and assumptions:
\layout Itemize

Mimimizing the amount of information extracted from past frames (for robustness
 to packet loss)
\layout Itemize

Dynamically-selectable codebooks (LSP, pitch and innovation)
\layout Itemize

LD-CELP-like fixed codebooks (without backward-adaptive grains) because
 of patent issues
\layout Section

Introduction to CELP coding
\layout Standard

Speex is based on the CELP, which stands for Code Excited Linear Prediction.
 This section attempts to introduce the principles behind CELP, so if you
 are already familiar with CELP, you can safely skip to section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:Speex-narrowband-mode}

\end_inset 

.
 The CELP technique is based on three ideas:
\layout Enumerate

The use of a linear prediction (LP) model to model the vocal tract
\layout Enumerate

The use of (adaptive and fixed) codebook entries as input (excitation) of
 the LP model
\layout Enumerate

The search performed in closed-loop in a

perceptually weighted domain

\layout Subsection

Linear prediction
\layout Standard

The linear prediction model represents each speech sample as linear combination
 of past samples, plus an error signal called the excitation (or residual).
\begin_inset Formula \[
x(n)=\sum _{i=1}^{N}a_{i}x(n-i)+e(n)\]

\end_inset 


\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \[
x(z)=\frac{1}{A(z)}\: e(z)\]

\end_inset 


\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \[
A(z)=1-\sum _{i=1}^{N}a_{i}z^{-i}\]

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

We usually refer to 
\begin_inset Formula $A(z)$
\end_inset 

 as the analysis filter and 
\begin_inset Formula $1/A(z)$
\end_inset 

 as the synthesis filter.
\layout Standard

The 
\begin_inset Formula $A(z)$
\end_inset 

 filter is computed using the Levinson-Durbin algorithm, which starts from
 the auto-correlation 
\begin_inset Formula $R(m)$
\end_inset 

 of the signal 
\begin_inset Formula $x(n)$
\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \[
r(m)=\sum _{i=0}^{N-1}x(i)x(i-m)\]

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

For an order 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset 

 filter, we have:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{R}=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
 r(0) & r(1) & \cdots  & r(N-1)\\
 r(1) & r(0) & \cdots  & r(N-2)\\
 \vdots  & \vdots  & \ddots  & \vdots \\
 r(N-1) & r(N-2) & \cdots  & r(0)\end{array}
\right]\]

\end_inset 


\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{r}=\left[\begin{array}{c}
 r(1)\\
 r(2)\\
 \vdots \\
 R(N)\end{array}
\right]\]

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

The filter coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}$
\end_inset 

 are found by solving the system.
 What the Levinson-Durbin algorithm does here is making the solution to
 the problem 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}\left(N^{2}\right)$
\end_inset 

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}\left(N^{3}\right)$
\end_inset 

 by exploiting the fact that matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{R}$
\end_inset 

 is toeplitz hermitian.
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{Ra}=\mathbf{r}\]

\end_inset

Pitch prediction
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \[
r(n)=\beta r(n-T)+c(n)\]

\end_inset 


\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \[
r(z)=\frac{1}{1-\beta z^{-T}}\: c(z)\]

\end_inset 

where 
\begin_inset Formula $c(n)$
\end_inset 

is taken from the

Innovation codebook
\layout Standard

This is where most of the bits in a CELP codec are allocated.
\layout Subsection

Analysis-by-synthesis and error weighting
\layout Standard

Most (if not all) modern audio codecs attempt to 
\emph on 
shape
\emph default 
 the noise so that it is the hardest to detect with the ear.
 That means that more noise can be tolerated in parts of the spectrum that
 are louder and 
\emph on 
vice versa
\emph default 
.
 
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
W(z)=\frac{A\left(\frac{z}{\gamma _{1}}\right)}{A\left(\frac{z}{\gamma _{2}}\right)}\label{eq:weighting_filter}\end{equation}

\end_inset 


\layout Section

Speex narrowband mode
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:Speex-narrowband-mode}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

This section looks at how Speex works for narrowband (
\begin_inset Formula $8\: \mathrm{kHz}$
\end_inset 

 sampling rate) operation.
 The frame size for this mode is 
\begin_inset Formula $20\: \mathrm{ms}$
\end_inset 

, corresponding to 160 samples.
 Each frame is also subdivided into 4 subframes of 40 samples each.
\layout Subsection

LPC analysis
\layout Standard

An LPC analysis is first performed on a (Hamming) window that spans all
 the current frame and half a frame in advance.
 The LPC coefficients are then converted to Line Spectral Pair (LSP), a
 represeitation that is more robust to quantization.
 The LSP's are quantized using 30 bits for higher quality modes and 18 bits
 for lower quality.
 The quantized LSP's are considered to be associated to the 
\begin_inset Formula $4^{th}$
\end_inset 

 subframes and the LSP's associated to the first 3 subframes are linearly
 interpolated using the current and previous LSP's.
\layout Standard

The perceptual weighting filter used by Speex corresponds to the one described
 by eq.
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:weighting_filter}

\end_inset 

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma _{1}=0.9$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma _{2}=0.6$
\end_inset 

.
 We can use the unquantized 
\begin_inset Formula $A(z)$
\end_inset 

 filter since the weighting filter is only used in the encoder.
\layout Subsection

Pitch prediction (adaptive codebook)
\layout Standard

Speex uses a 3-tap prediction for pitch.
 That is, 
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \[
r(n)=\beta _{0}r(n-T-1)+\beta _{1}r(n-T)+\beta _{2}r(n-T+1)+c(n)\]

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

where 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset 

 is the pitch period and the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta _{i}$
\end_inset 

 are the prediction (filter) taps.
\layout Subsection

Innovation codebook
\layout Standard

In Speex, the innovation signal is quantized using shape-only vector quantizatio
n (VQ).
 That means that the codebooks that are used represent both the shape and
 the gain at the same time.
 This save many bits that would otherwise be allocated for a separate gain
 at the price of a slight increase in complexity.
 Except for the absence of (backward-adaptive) gain, the technique used
 in Speex is similar to LD-CELP.
 However since we do not have a low-delay constraint, the search can be
 made more 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

global
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 and make use of the whole information available for a sub-frame.
\layout Section

Speex wideband mode (sub-band CELP)
\layout Standard

For wideband, the Speex approach is similar to the ITU-T G.722 (ADPCM) wideband
 standard in that it uses a 
\emph on 
q
\emph default 
uadrature 
\emph on 
m
\emph default 
irror 
\emph on 
f
\emph default 
ilter (QMF) to split the band in two.
 The 16 kHz signal is thus divided into two 8 kHz signals, one representing
 the low band (0-4 kHz), the other the high band (4-8 kHz).
 The low band is encoded with the narrowband mode described in section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:Speex-narrowband-mode}

\end_inset 

 in such a way that the resulting 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

embedded narrowband bit-stream
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 can also be decoded with the narrowband decoder.
 Since the low band encoding has already been described only the high band
 encoding is described in this section.
\layout Subsection

Linear prediction
\layout Standard

The linear prediction part used for the high-band is very similar to what
 is done for narrowband.
 The only difference is that we use only 12 bits to encode the high-band
 LSP's.
