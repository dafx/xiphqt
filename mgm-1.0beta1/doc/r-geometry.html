<h1>Resource: geometry</h1>
<h2>applicability</h2>

Toplevel only

<h2>possible settings</h2>
Standard X geometry format (egs., 300x100, 35x400-0+0)<br>
default computed from overall configuration<p>

<h2>description</h2>

The geometry resource is used to force a specific height/width and/or
screen placement for the MGM window.  It is possible to set a height
or width below the minimums MGM woudl otherwise allow; in this case,
MGM will generally break.<p>

<h2>default geometry computation</h2>

The default geometry depends on the graph orientation (set using <a
href=r-bars.html>bars</a>), the stack direction (set using <a
href=r-stack.html>stack</a>), the number of active modules (modules
may be enabled or disabled using <a href=r-active.html>active</a>),
relative module length and width adjustmants (set using <a
href=r-scalelendadj.html>scalelenadj</a> and <a
href=r-scalewidadj.html>scalewidadj</a>) and the global adjustment
setting to pixel settings (set using <a
href=r-lendemand.html>lendemand</a> and <a
href=widdemand.html>widdemand</a>).<p>

Geometry and placement are computed using only active modules.  Scale
length and width adjustments are collected for all modules in order to
find the global adjustments.  The global adjustment is either the
maximum of the local adjustments or the sum of them; for example, an
MGM with vertical bars that are stacked horizontally (the bars are
side-by-side), the global scale length adjustment is the maximum of
the individual module length adjustment settings, and the global width
adjustment is the sum of the individual width adjustments.  Visualize
this for a second until it's obvious why; the x size of the window
described above is the sum of the widths of the graphs and the y size
is as high as the tallest.<p>

The same process is used to find the global minimum x and y sizes from
the local minimum x and y specified by each module.  MGM enforces at each
step that the computed geometries are not less than the minimum
settings specified by individual modules (unless the geometry is
forced to a smaller-than-minimum size by frobbing the minx, miny or
geometry resources).<p>

After computing the global length and width adjustment settings, the
adjustment values are mapped to actual pixel width and height by
multiplying with the lendemand and widdemand values, dividing by 100,
and mapping length/width to x and y depeneding on graph orientation
(vertical bars will map width to x and length to y.  Horizontal bars
map length to x and width to y).<p>

Module placement is determined after the global x and y sizes are
known. MGM determines 'excess' x and y values by subtracting the
global minimum x and y values from the actual mapped x and y values.
This excess is then added to the minimum x and y settings of each
module as determined by the scalelenadj and scalewidadj settings for
that module.  (remember that 'width' and 'length' map to x,y or y,x
depending on graph orientation).  For example, in a graph with
vertical bars, the size of a specific module can be computed as
follows:<p>

<pre>
module_x=(global_actual_x-global_minimum_x)/global_scalewidadj*
          local_scalewidadj<br>
module_y=(global_actual_y-global_minimum_y)/global_scalelenadj*
          local_scalelenadj<br>
</pre>

One last note; the minimum actual length and width adjustments as used
internally are both 1; this prevents division by zero problems when
using a single module that uses adjustments of zero.<p.

<h2>tricks</h2> The complicated (but still farily lean) process above
is designed to give decent default sizing and placement.  It can be
hard to tweak for specific purposes.<p>

It is possible to force each module to a specific, exact size
completely overriding the automatic placement.  This is done by
setting the scalelenadj and scalewidadj to zero and specifying an
exact size using minx and miny for each module.<p>

MGM will not get your whites whiter or your colors brighter.  It will,
however, sit there and look spiffy while sucking down a major
honking wad of RAM.<p>
