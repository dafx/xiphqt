Plan to make things less quick-and-dirty:

* get rough audio playback working
* get rough sync working

* refactor stream handlers into separate modules with a generic 
  interface
* rough seek support
* Add speex, flac, mng support

* refactor module interface to provide generic uncompressed media?
* rename to 'oggplay' and move to the ogg-tools package?

* http support
* abstract module interface into a library
* UI to switch between and turn on and off various muxed tracks
* fine seek support

* dynamic load support for stream handlers?
* support jack?
* support libao+libvo?
