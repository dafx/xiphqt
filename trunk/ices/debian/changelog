ices2 (1.9+2.0beta2+20030714-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New daily snapshot build.
  * Renamed source and binary packages to ices2 from ices, as well as
    installed binary and manual page.
  * Updated versioning scheme so the final 2.0 release can be numbered 
    like 2.0-1, without an epoch.
  * Conflicts: and Replaces: ices (2.0.cvs030704-0.1), hopefully 
    facilitating automatic upgrades from the old package names.

ices (2.0.cvs030704-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Constructed a build script to completely automate the construction
    of the 'pristine' tarball from CVS.  This doesn't really effect the
    contents of the package, just makes it easier for me to rebuild.
  * New CVS source.
