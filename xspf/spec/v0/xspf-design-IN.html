		<dd>
		  <p>This document is an informal explanation of the XSPF
			playlist format.  It is intended to explain what we did
			and why we did it.  See <a
			href="http://xspf.org">xspf.org</a> for formal
			documentation.</p>

		<dt>What is XSPF?</dt>
		<dd>
		  <p>XSPF is an XML playlist format.  It is an acronym which
		  stands for XML Shareable Playlist Format.  The acronym may
		  be pronounced "spiff" or "spliff". </p>
		</dd>

		<dt>Why XSPF?</dt>
		<dd>

		  <p>Assuming -- arrogantly, as I have to -- that XSPF is good
		  enough, before XSPF there was no SGML-like format for
		  playlists that could measure up to the standards of the
		  SGML-like formats for web pages (HTML), weblogs (RSS), and
		  web graphs (RDF).</p>

		  <p>It was evident that there was a need for an XML format.
		  XML is the preferred data description language of the
		  moment.  The tools and skills to use it are ubiquitous.  New
		  XML playlist formats pop up on a regular basis.</p>

		  <p>It was also evident that existing playlist formats fell
		  short.  ASX (for Windows Media Player) and the iTunes
		  library format are proprietary.  M3U, RAM, and QuickTime are
		  not SGML-like.  Gnomoradio RDF is a one-man project without
		  the resources to go all the way.  SMIL is too hard to
		  implement.  The timing model of RSS doesn't fit audio and
		  video.  Forcing timing models into HTML, as HTML+Time does,
		  creates an unintelligible feature set.  Few of these formats
		  are well documented.  Few make simple features easy and hard
		  features possible.  Only one is an open standard.  Not a
		  single one offers interoperability across major vendors.
		  Not a single one attempts to solve these problems.</p>

		</dd>

		<dt>Who is involved?</dt>
		<dd><p>There are representatives from two major technology
		vendors who needed a well-made XML playlist format for
		commercial reasons.  There is one person from the W3C whose
		motivation was, I think, to offer the benefit of experience in
		the standards process.  There are three hackers from the free
		and open source community whose motivation is to fix something
		which is broken.  The hackers -- myself, Robert Kaye, and
		Matthias Freidrich -- have done the bulk of work.</p></dd>
