ezstream README
------------------------------

WHAT IS IT ?
::::::::::::

ezstream is a command line utility which is a improved version of the old 
"shout" utility.  It enables you to stream mp3 or vorbis files to an icecast 
server without reencoding and thus requires very little CPU.  ezstream is 
controlled via a XML config file (a few examples are provided in the conf
directory).

ezstream can stream mp3 and ogg vorbis files as well as reading from stdin.
ID3v1 tags are supported in mp3 files and all ogg vorbis tags are propagated
as metadata as well.


CONFIG FILE
:::::::::::

The following is an example config file :

<ezstream>
    <url>http://localhost:8000/testmount.ogg</url>
    <sourcepassword>hackme</sourcepassword>
    <format>OGGVORBIS</format>
    <filename>sunking.ogg</filename>
    <svrinfoname>My Stream</svrinfoname>    
    <svrinfourl>http://www.oddsock.org</svrinfourl> 
    <svrinfogenre>RockNRoll</svrinfogenre>
    <svrinfodescription>This is a stream description</svrinfodescription>
    <svrinfobitrate>192</svrinfobitrate>    
    <svrinfoquality>4.0</svrinfoquality>    
    <svrinfochannels>2</svrinfochannels>
    <svrinfosamplerate>44100</svrinfosamplerate>
    <svrinfopublic>1</svrinfopublic>    
</ezstream>

URL - this URL specified the location and mountpoint of the icecast server 
	  to which the stream will be sent.
SOURCEPASSWORD - the source password for the icecast server
FORMAT - either MP3 or OGGVORBIS, you must specify which format you input
         files are in.
FILENAME - This can be a single file (in which ezstream will stream that
           file over and over continuously) or can be a .m3u file which
           is a playlist of files.  currently, ezstream will go through 
           the files sequentially.  If you specify "stdin" as the filename
           then ezstream will read the input from stdin.
SVRINFONAME - Broadcast name (informational only)
SVRINFOURL - Website associated with the broadcast (informational only)
SVRINFOGENRE - Genre of broadcast (informational only) (used for YP)
SVRINFODESCRIPTION - Description of broadcast (informational only) (used for YP)
SVRINFOBITRATE - Bitrate of broadcast (informational only) (used for YP)
                 It is YOUR responsibility to ensure that the bitrate specified
                 here matches up with your input.  Note that this info is not
                 for anything OTHER than YP listing info.
SVRINFOQUALITY - Used only for OggVorbis streams, similar to the bitrate
                 in that it is used only for informational and YP purposes.
SVRINFOCHANNELS - 1 = MONO, 2 = STEREO (informational only) (used for YP)
SVRINFOSAMPLERATE - (informational only) (used for YP)
SVRINFOPUBLIC - Indicates wether to list this stream in a public YP.
