2007-07-24 13:04  moritz

	* [r13296] src/ezstream.c:
	  Fix the dang file descriptor leak of < 0.4.1 for good; the old
	  fix only took care of it partially. Diagnosed with the help from
	  someone, who wishes to stay anonymous. Thanks!

	  the copy of ptr to NULL. Spotted by Karl Heyes, thanks a lot!

2007-03-07 23:39  moritz

2007-03-04 15:50  moritz

	* [r12629] src/playlist.c:
	  While rand() being crappy is true for most/all *nix systems, on
	  Windows, this is different. The shifting severely screwed up its
	  randomness. Just leave it away and systems that only have a bad
	  version of rand() will have to just deal with it.

	  Iterate back towards working Windows support.

2007-03-03 12:42  moritz

	* [r12614] src/ezstream.c:
	  STDERR_FILENO -> fileno(stderr), and fix a brain'o: Systems with
	  limited or no signals support obviously don't have
	  SIG_HUP/SIG_USR1 defined.

2007-03-02 12:52  moritz

	* [r12603] configure.in, src/Makefile.am, src/configfile.c,
	  src/ezstream.c, src/strfctns.h, src/strlcat.c, src/strlcpy.c,
	  src/strlfctns.h, src/strtonum.c:
	  Improve string to integer conversion stuff, and have another stab
	  at the config file parsing. Ezstream now prints each error it can
	  find and then bails out, instead of bailing out on the first
	  error. Tweak URL parsing as well, and do some cosmetic changes to
	  the error messages.

2007-03-02 00:57  moritz

	* [r12599] NEWS, doc/ezstream.1.in, src/configfile.c,
	  src/configfile.h, src/ezstream.c:
	  Allow users to restrict the number of reconnection attempts. This
	  also changes how reconnections are handled in general: A
	  recovered connection always skips to the next tune as well, as it
	  seems that at least for Ogg Vorbis, libshout wants to see an Ogg
	  header after a shout_open(). The new code makes this behavior
	  consistent among all formats.

2007-03-01 14:50  moritz

	* [r12597] configure.in, src/ezstream.c, src/playlist.c,
	  src/strlcat.c, src/strlcpy.c, src/util.c:
	  Enable more warnings on gcc, and do some miscellaneous cleanups.

2007-03-01 01:22  moritz

	* [r12596] src/ezstream.c:
	  Redirect only de-/encoder screen output to /dev/null with -q, and
	  restore standard error outside that popen() call.

2007-03-01 00:34  moritz

	* [r12595] m4/shout.m4:

	  src/ezstream.c:
	  Add new <stream_once> configuration option for disabling

	  src/configfile.c, src/configfile.h, src/ezstream.c,
	  src/playlist.c, src/playlist.h:
	  Add new playlist scripting feature (works similar to Ices 2.x.)

2007-02-28 15:35  moritz

	* [r12590] configure.in, src/ezstream.c:
	  Replace geteuid() check with stat(), and make it an error if the
	  configuration file is group or world writeable. This is actually
	  what the warning about root was all about.

2007-02-28 13:53  moritz

	* [r12589] src/Makefile.am, src/ezsignals.h, src/ezstream.c:
	  Back out hardly used ezsignals.h.

2007-02-28 12:47  moritz

	* [r12588] NEWS:
	  Remove redundant paragraph.

2007-02-28 12:44  moritz

	* [r12587] CHANGELOG, ChangeLog, Makefile.am, NEWS, mkcl.sh:
	  Make a more standard distribution: Rename CHANGELOG to NEWS,
	  bring back the complete ChangeLog and add mkcl.sh that contains
	  the options to generate ChangeLog.

2007-02-28 11:06  moritz

	* [r12586] CHANGELOG, ChangeLog, Makefile.am:
	  Switch from a generated ChangeLog to a manually maintained and
	  more compact CHANGELOG.

2007-02-28 11:03  moritz

	* [r12585] src/ezstream.c:
	  Sync usageHelp() with new reality.

2007-02-27 14:44  moritz

	* [r12576] configure.in:
	  Let MIPS[pro] C be chatty with warnings and check for basename()
	  in libgen. Ezstream now builds on IRIX.

2007-02-27 14:42  moritz

	* [r12575] src/ezstream.c:
	  getopt() returns int, not char.

2007-02-27 14:41  moritz

	* [r12574] m4/xiph_xml2.m4:
	  Use backticks to execute xml2-config/xslt-config, which is more
	  portable.

2007-02-27 12:46  moritz

	* [r12573] README:
	  Document a caveat when building ezstream on Solaris with a
	  different compiler than the one used to build libshout.

2007-02-26 20:29  moritz

	* [r12572] configure.in, m4/shout.m4:
	  Make this work on static archs, and get one step closer to SunCC
	  support on Solaris. Also, don't complain if libshout isn't
	  thread-safe, as Ezstream isn't multithreaded.

2007-02-26 19:59  moritz

	* [r12571] Makefile.am, configure.in, m4/Makefile.am:
	  Add m4/ to the distribution tarball.

2007-02-26 15:28  moritz

	* [r12570] Makefile.am, m4/ogg.m4, m4/vorbis.m4:
	  Unbreak "make distcheck": $prefix is not a good default, use
	  /usr/local instead. This makes it more likely that installed
	  libogg and libvorbis are found, when the user (or autoconf)
	  specifies a different --prefix. Users who installed their
	  libraries in their homedir now have to set $OGG_PREFIX and
	  $VORBIS_PREFIX, or set their respective --with arguments. Let the
	  snapshot target use distcheck now that it works.

2007-02-26 02:56  moritz

	* [r12565] m4/ac_config_libconfig_in.m4, m4/acx_pthread.m4,
	  m4/ogg.m4, m4/shout.m4, m4/vorbis.m4, m4/xiph_compiler.m4,

	  m4/xiph_types.m4, m4/xiph_xml2.m4:
	  Remove unused .m4 files and sync the used ones with Icecast.

2007-02-25 18:28  moritz

	* [r12564] src/ezstream.c:
	  Make Ezstream work properly and do the right thing, even when
	  bombarded with a flurry of simultaneous SIGHUP and SIGUSR1
	  signals. From what I can tell, signal handling is now quite solid
	  now. Achieve this by moving most of streamFile() into a new
	  sendStream() function, which is called within a new do-while loop
	  inside streamFile(). There, proper behavior is ensured and a race
	  condition resolved in favor of SIGHUP.

2007-02-25 16:00  moritz

	* [r12563] src/ezstream.c:
	  Switch from using signal() to sigaction() and friends, so that
	  SA_RESTART can be used. This is required for Solaris and possibly
	  others, where signal handlers have to be reinstalled after having
	  caught one signal via signal(). Also prevent Ezstream from being
	  killed by a handled signal in streamFile(), where they can
	  interrupt fread()'s system calls. This improves matters, but
	  isn't perfect, yet. A SIGHUP signal can still cause skipping to
	  the next track, which should be triggered only by SIGUSR1.

2007-02-25 14:00  moritz

	* [r12562] Makefile.am, conf/Makefile.am, configure.in,
	  src/Makefile.am, src/configfile.c, src/configfile.h,
	  src/ezstream.c, win32/Makefile.am:
	  Various cleanups and auto-fu tweaks. * Make Makefile.am files
	  look alike as much as possible. * Remove debug: target and don't
	  mess with the users DEBUG environment variable: Autoconf checks
	  for -g and automatically adds it to CFLAGS, which is overridden
	  by the user's $DEBUG. If the user didn't specify one, "make
	  install" will strip the resulting binaries and leave the
	  debugging symbols intact otherwise. * Remove profile: target, as
	  it is quite pointless in Ezstream. Also, the user can add
	  profiling flags via the $DEBUG variable as well. * Remove
	  -ffast-math and -fsigned-char from gcc, and enable two additional
	  warnings instead. * Unconfuse Solaris compiler flags
	  (unfortunately, the configure script still fails in the libshout
	  check with some obscure linker error): Do not force -x04 and
	  -fast optimizations, let the user decide (it doesn't matter for
	  Ezstream anyways.) Remove -xgc92, which is deprecated and
	  actually makes the resulting binary run slower on SPARC. Also
	  remove -fsimple, which does not help and has the potential of
	  causing trouble, and don't enable verbose warnings just to
	  disable them afterwards with -w. Leave only -v for verbose
	  warnings. * Const'ify getFormat*() functions and blankString, and
	  squelch a few const- related warnings. * Squelch a signedness
	  warning and fix two ;; syntax errors. * Add a snapshot target to
	  Makefile.am that creates a tarball of the form
	  ezstream-snapshot-YYYYMMDD.tar.gz.

	* [r12557] src/ezstream.c:
	  Merge changes to the remaining two functions, openResource() and
	  streamFile(), after which the merge is complete. Changes in
	  openResource(): * Let the caller know whether we're streaming
	  from standard input, and give it a copy of the metadata
	  information. * Make filename extension matching case insensitive.
	  Ezstream can now stream foo.Ogg out of playlist.tXt. (On that
	  note, another item from the parseConfig() commit log message was
	  missing: <format/> and <match/> are also case insensitive now.)
	  Changes in streamFile(): * New feature: Skip currently playing
	  track when receiving SIGUSR1. * New feature: When using both the
	  new -q and -v command line parameters, Ezstream now displays some
	  "real-time" information: playlist position, elapsed time
	  streaming the current track, and approximate bitrate in kbps. *
	  Fix the fread() loop by moving the "if read bytes > 0" condition
	  into the while statement, and check with ferror() afterwards
	  whether an error occured. * Remove redundant shout_delay() call.
	  Ezstream puts itself to sleep with shout_sync(). * Return a value
	  that makes sense in main()'s do-while loop, instead of whatever
	  shout_send() returned last. * Remove or prettify a few messages.

2007-02-25 03:10  moritz

	* [r12554] src/ezstream.c:
	  Merge processMetadata() changes: * Fix how the metadata string is
	  generated. Don't include the " - " in the output if either artist
	  or title are missing from ID3v1/Vorbis tags. * Print the correct
	  error message when ov_open() fails. * Improve filename-based
	  generation of metadata. Use a copy of fileName for basename(),
	  which may modify its argument in some places where the old, weird
	  POSIX implementation is used. Also, basename() is not infallible,
	  but when it fails, it is annoying for us. Assert that it cannot
	  fail since we feed it with path names < PATH_MAX (handled in
	  playlist.c and configfile.c.) In short, make processMetadata()
	  always return something more or less useful as long as the file
	  in question can be opened.

2007-02-25 02:36  moritz

	* [r12553] src/ezstream.c:
	  Merge changes to replaceString() and buildCommandString(), and do
	  the formatting nitpickery to setMetadata(). Changes in
	  replaceString(): * Fix a heap overflow. replaceString() would
	  happily replace multiple '@T@' and '@M@' placeholders and write
	  into *dest until things blow up. Fix this by using safe string
	  functions. Then completely prevent it by ensuring that it
	  replaces only one placeholder per call (adjusting
	  buildCommandString() accordingly) and already complaining to the
	  user in parseConfig() about illegal, multiple placeholders in
	  their command lines. (That parseConfig() change was missing from
	  the commit log earlier.) In buildCommandString(): * Use xcalloc()
	  instead of malloc() and get rid of the now redundant memset()
	  calls. * Allow decoder command lines to contain the '@M@'
	  metadata placeholder. Useful for combined de-/encoders like
	  ffmpeg2theora. * Tweak message about "unsupported" format, which
	  used to be false in the case of Ogg Theora streams. * Plug
	  several memory leaks. * Don't print the "Executing command 'foo'"
	  message in this function.

2007-02-25 01:14  moritz

	* [r12552] src/ezstream.c:
	  Merge changes to main(), urlParse() and streamPlaylist(). In
	  main(): * Install the signal handler as late as possible. * Add
	  new command line options: -v (verbose, use twice for even more
	  verbose output) and -q (quiet, redirect standard error output
	  from external de-/ encoders to /dev/null.) * It is now an error
	  to supply more than one -c parameter. This prevents unexpected
	  results. * Add a stern warning when ezstream is running as root.
	  Just Don't Do It. Leaving the configfile writeable to others by
	  accident could mean instant root compromise. * Before handing the
	  config file over to libxml, try to open it ourselves first. The
	  error message from strerror() is a lot more helpful than the
	  cryption I/O error printed by libxml. * Don't preallocate memory
	  for urlParse(). * Fix command line error messages, they seem to
	  be for a different program than Ezstream. * More terse libshout
	  error messages, just print which function failed. I consider
	  these errors of questionable value for an end user, but at least
	  a knowledgeable one will know instantly what went wrong. * Case
	  insensitive matching of playlist file extensions. * Print the
	  address, port and mountpoint that Ezstream is actually trying to
	  connect to, instead of what the user supplied. That should make
	  it easier to spot reasons for connect failures (e.g. typos.)
	  Changes in urlParse(): * Let urlParse() allocate memory for
	  hostname and mountpoint, as it knows how much memory is actually
	  required. * Fix a buffer overflow of the tmpPort buffer by adding
	  checks and using safe string functions. * Let the caller print an
	  error message, instead of having the same printf() twice in
	  urlParse(). The streamPlaylist() function has been rewritten to
	  use the new playlist_*() routines. Apart from the added playlist
	  shuffle feature no functional change.

2007-02-25 00:35  moritz

	* [r12551] configure.in:
	  Add check for geteuid(), which is better than checking for WIN32.

2007-02-25 00:25  moritz

	* [r12550] src/ezstream.c:
	  Begin merging ezstream.c changes. This first batch includes: *
	  License reference and various #include cleanups and additions
	  that are required later. * Add new usage() and usageHelp()
	  functions (which already contain what's to come.) Move them close
	  to main() where getopt() is called. * New signal handler, which
	  now no longer uses printf(). printf() is not safe to use in
	  signal handlers. Use volatile sig_atomic_t types instead of ints
	  as flags to set in the handler. * Formatting and const'ifying of
	  WIN32-basename() and strrcmp(). Rearrange them so that the actual
	  "worker functions" are grouped together. * Add function
	  prototypes for those that are already up-to-date. * Rename
	  ReplaceString() to replaceString() for consistency with other
	  function names in Ezstream. * Prepare for portable *__progname
	  usage.

2007-02-24 23:26  moritz

	* [r12549] src/configfile.c:
	  Merge new parseConfig() function. There were many changes, but
	  those are too cumbersome to merge separately. They are: * The
	  usual formatting nitpickings. * Don't leak memory in case of
	  duplicate entries. Instead make it an error and print a helpful
	  error message, with config file line number, to the user. *
	  Replace the manual cast to (const xmlChar *) with libxml2's
	  BAD_CAST. There probably won't be any UTF8 support in Ezstream
	  any time soon ... * Remove redundant strlen() check -
	  xmlNodeListGetString() never returns an empty string if
	  (cur->xmlChildrenNode != NULL). * Use xstrdup() instead of
	  malloc() + memset() + strcpy(). * Ensure that boolean
	  configration options are always either 1 or 0. * Ensure that path
	  names given via <filename /> do not exceed PATH_MAX. * Add
	  <shuffle /> configuration option for playlist shuffling.

2007-02-24 23:05  moritz

	* [r12548] src/configfile.c:
	  Add function to free a configuration in case of an error.

2007-02-24 23:03  moritz

	* [r12547] configure.in:
	  Fix typo in comment.

2007-02-24 22:56  moritz

	* [r12546] src/configfile.c:
	  Replace three if-conditionals with one, both in
	  getFormatEncoder() and getFormatDecoder(), with prettier
	  formatting.

2007-02-24 22:50  moritz

	* [r12545] src/configfile.c, src/configfile.h:
	  Const'ify configfile functions.

2007-02-24 22:25  moritz

	* [r12544] src/configfile.c, src/configfile.h:
	  Add license reference to configfile.c, sync #includes with what
	  will be required later, getEZConfig() formatting and remove
	  unused printConfig() function.

2007-02-24 22:16  moritz

	* [r12543] src/configfile.h:
	  Begin merging configfile.* changes by cleaning up the .h file:
	  Add license reference, remove prototype of nonexistent
	  getMetadataGrabber() function, and do some formatting.

2007-02-24 22:03  moritz

	* [r12542] win32/Makefile.am:
	  Clean core and backup files in this directory as well. Only ~2500
	  lines of diffs left to merge.

2007-02-24 22:01  moritz

	* [r12541] src/ezsignals.h:
	  Commit header with three macros that help with signal handling.
	  Will be actually used later. Now, all new files are in.

2007-02-24 21:59  moritz

	* [r12540] configure.in:
	  Let the configure script set a (hard-coded, for now) examples
	  installation directory. This will be made configurable later.

2007-02-24 21:50  moritz

	* [r12539] configure.in:
	  Add several checks that we need now, i.e. very soon.

2007-02-24 21:46  moritz

	* [r12538] configure.in:
	  AM_CONFIG_HEADER -> AC_CONFIG_HEADERS, and move config.h into
	  src/.

2007-02-24 21:44  moritz

	* [r12537] configure.in:
	  Autoconf 2.61 has a nice macro AC_USE_SYSTEM_EXTENSIONS. Use it,
	  depend on autoconf-2.61 for it and remove the annoying
	  _GNU_SOURCE and _XOPEN_SOURCE ... dung. Autoconf takes care of
	  this, and even checks for more useful stuff for us.

2007-02-24 21:37  moritz

	* [r12536] configure.in:
	  Generate a Makefile in doc/, and switch to AC_CONFIG_FILES.

2007-02-24 21:34  moritz

	* [r12535] configure.in:
	  Ezstream does not need libtool, so remove it. Remove other
	  redundant configure checks as well: AC_PROG_CC and AC_HEADER_STDC
	  are automatically checked in packages written in C, no need to do
	  it twice. This shaves a lot off configure runtime.

2007-02-24 21:29  moritz

	* [r12534] configure.in:
	  Start to incrementally merge configure.in changes by simply
	  shuffling code around a bit. No functional change, yet.

2007-02-24 21:19  moritz

	* [r12533] Makefile.am:
	  Hook up doc/ with the build, depend on automake 1.9 and remove
	  dist-zip for now. The latter will come back after testing on
	  Windows has been done.

2007-02-24 21:16  moritz

	* [r12532] autogen.sh:
	  Replace the autogen behemoth with something much simpler.
	  AC_PREREQ and AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS already take care of version
	  checks.

2007-02-24 21:12  moritz

	* [r12531] conf/Makefile.am, conf/ezstream_mp3.xml,
	  conf/ezstream_reencoding_example_mp3.xml,
	  conf/ezstream_reencoding_example_theora.xml,
	  conf/ezstream_reencoding_example_vorbis.xml,
	  conf/ezstream_vorbis.xml:
	  Clean up and install example configuration files.

2007-02-24 21:11  moritz

	* [r12530] README:
	  Commit rewritten README file.

2007-02-24 20:59  moritz

	* [r12529] AUTHORS:
	  Remove AUTHORS. Credits are in the man page.

2007-02-24 20:58  moritz

	* [r12528] INSTALL:
	  Add INSTALL file for those not familiar with the configure+make
	  dance. From autoconf-2.61.

2007-02-24 20:57  moritz

	* [r12527] src/Makefile.am, src/strlcat.c, src/strlcpy.c,
	  src/strlfctns.h:
	  Add files with safe strlc*() string functions, and hook all new
	  files into Makefile.am. Also let "make clean" clean up coredumps
	  and editor backup files.

2007-02-24 20:52  moritz

	* [r12526] doc, doc/Makefile.am, doc/ezstream.1.in:
	  Add ezstream man page.

2007-02-24 20:50  moritz

	* [r12525] src/playlist.c, src/playlist.h:
	  Add new playlist handling functions.

2007-02-24 20:49  moritz

	* [r12524] src/util.c, src/util.h:
	  Add new utility functions, for memory management. These do The
	  Right Thing and never return NULL.

2007-02-24 18:55  moritz

	* [r12521] configure.in:
	  Begin to incrementally merge my changes to Ezstream by bumping
	  the version number and shifting blame to me. This should keep
	  most of the history in my local CVS repository. There may be
	  temporary breakages where it doesn't build or package until I'm
	  done.

2005-12-14 21:40  oddsock

	* [r10593] win32/Makefile.am:
	  forgot to add the inno setup installer to the dist

2004-04-21 13:48  oddsock

	* [r6563] configure.in, src/.deps, src/ezstream.c:
	  added ability to send a signal (SIGHUP) which will re-read the
	  current playlist (m3u) that is being processed. When this
	  happens, ezstream will pick up from the last track that was
	  played.

2004-02-02 04:56  oddsock

	* [r5806] README:
	  stdin now working :)
