| \ezstream.1.html      | The ezstream manual in HTML format. It is    |
|                       | automatically generated and looks very bad,  |
|                       | but should be readable enough to be useful.  |
+-----------------------+----------------------------------------------+
| \ezstream.exe         | The ezstream executable file.                |
+-----------------------+----------------------------------------------+
| \conf\*.xml           | Ezstream example configuration files.        |

2. Installation
---------------


As of version 0.3.0, ezstream no longer comes with an installer. If you have a
previous version of ezstream installed, you might want to simply uninstall it.

The ezstream.exe file will work from any location. To install it, simply copy
it to a location of your choosing. Add this place to your PATH environment
variable, if ezstream.exe is supposed to be executable from anywhere on the
system.
