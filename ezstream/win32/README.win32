2. Installation
---------------


As of version 0.3.0, ezstream no longer comes with an installer. If you have a
previous version of ezstream installed, you might want to simply uninstall it.

The ezstream.exe file will work from any location. To install it, simply copy
it to a location of your choosing. Add this place to your PATH environment
variable, if ezstream.exe is supposed to be executable from anywhere on the
system.



3. Limited functionality
------------------------


A few useful features are missing in the Windows version of ezstream. Runtime
control via signals is not possible, and native metadata support is restricted
to MP3 (ID3v1) and Ogg Vorbis tags.



4. Source code
--------------


Ezstream uses libxml2 (http://xmlsoft.org/, BSD-like license), libogg and
libvorbis (http://www.vorbis.com/, BSD-like license) and libshout
(http://www.icecast.org/, LGPL licensed). These libraries are statically linked
into the ezstream.exe file.

Ezstream itself is licensed under the GPL (see COPYING in the included source
archive for details.)
