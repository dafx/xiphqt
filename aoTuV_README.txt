aoTuV beta2 release note

"aoTuV" tunes up libvorbis 1.0.1 uniquely. 
A license is taken as "BSD-style license" as well as original libvorbis. 


# NOTICE #

 On the frequency of 26kHz or more, q-2(nominal 40kbps/44.1-48kHz) can be used.  A part of Nominal bitrate has changed. 
 Use of bitrate management mode is not recommended. (In the future, psy.c and mapping0.c will need to be improved. )  Please specify this, when you compile this code and you distribute a binary. If you want to improve this portion, I welcome. ÅiFor the moment, there is no schedule for which I improve this problem. )



aoTuV based on <Xiph.Org libvorbis 1.0.1>
