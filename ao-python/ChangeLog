	* aomodule.[ch] Updated to work with the updated ao API.
	  Not entirely sure the way of dealing with files is perfect,
	  but it should be serviceable.

	* aomodule.[ch] Changed some of the function names so that they
	  look more like their C counterparts (getting rid of get_ 
	  in function names, for example)

	* README: Fixed incorrect config instructions
	
2001-01-31  Andrew H. Chatham <andrew.chatham@duke.edu>
	* setup.py, config_unix.py, setup.cfg: Went back to an older way
	of configuring things, which seems to be the only maintainable way
	to do it until distutils has better configuration
	support. "./setup.py bdist_rpm" should work fine now.
