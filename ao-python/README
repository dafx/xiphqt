pyao - a Python wrapper module for the ao library

This is a wrapper for libao, an audio device abstraction
library. libao is available with ogg/vorbis at http://www.xiph.org.

To build you need distutils package from
http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/download.html (it comes with
Python 2.0). First edit setup.py so that the AO_INCLUDE_DIR and
AO_LIB_DIR point to the right place. Type "python setup.py build" and
then "python setup.py install" as root to install the module.

Access the module by using "import ao" in your Python code.

There is currently a problem where you can't use any ao output plugin
which requires a symbol inside libao. This has something to do with
linker magic and dlopen voodoo. Everything works fine compiled into a
program, but linked into a Python module, libao's ao_is_big_endian
function isn't available to the plugins it opens (most importantly,
'oss'). If anybody has any clue, please let me know how to fix this...

Also, right now (Nov-28-2000) the CVS for ao is a little inconsistent.
