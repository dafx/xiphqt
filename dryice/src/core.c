  /* BIG TODO

  Ok after the configs are read, which for now will be hard-coded 
  because I'm lazy and want to leave config file parsing for someone
  else, we'll open the input module(s), get the parameters for encoding,
  then open the codec module(s) with those parameters.

  Take the packets from the codec(s), toss them into an Ogg, ship the 
  whole thing out to libtheora with raw packets.  There is no need to 
  sleep since the stream is already running realtime, and thus, no need
  to do threading/etc as IceS2 does.  We'll basically just use libshout2
  for it's ability to initiate and pass data to Icecast2.
