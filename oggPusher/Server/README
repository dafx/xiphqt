Presently the URL for the upload is hardcoded as 
http://www.it.iitb.ac.in/~nithind/post.php

the files are supposed to be created in uploads dir in my home directory


8/7/2008 For testing purpose i have added two files
1)upload.php

please place this in /var/www/ the default dir for apache server.
Also create one directory uploads in /var/www/

2)sample_form.php

This take a file input and submit the action to upload.php
so the url is http://localhost/upload.php
If you have placed upload.php in any public server you can edit sample_form.php to replace 
localhost with the url of your server.
If the file is uploaded successfully, and message appears
File is successfully uploaded.
