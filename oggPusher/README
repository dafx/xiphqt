OggPusher is a proposed browser extension for converting ffmpeg supported formats of video to ogg format files. A Gui which provides the interface for uploading files, and then shows feedback how much of the file is uploaded. In case of resuming the feedback can be obtained through a XMLHttpRequest call. Server implementation of zero config or Resume functionality is expected.
