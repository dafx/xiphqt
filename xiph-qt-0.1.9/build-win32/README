Building - Win32
================

To build XiphQT on for Win32 OS you will need Visual-C compiler,
QuickTime SDK 7 for Win32 and a set of statically compiled Xiph
libraries (ogg, vorbis, speex).

By default, the QT SDK is expected to be installed in the default location:
C:\Program Files\QuickTime SDK
and the Xiph libraries are supposed to be located in the same directory
as 'xiph-qt' directory (using simple library names, without numerical
version suffixes). 

The project files will build XiphQT in a single file XiphQT.qtx and then
install it in the default directory for third-party QuickTime components:
C:\Program Files\QuickTime\QTComponents


Installing - Win32
==================

The binary component file XiphQT.qtx needs to be installed in 'QTComponents'
sub-folder of your QuickTime installation.
