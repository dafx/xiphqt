<p> MGM, the Moaning Goat Meter, is the ultimate sixty-ton cast iron
lawn ornament for the desktops of today's hacker set: A gorgeous,
highly configurable load and status meter written entirely in Perl.
Serious pink-flamingo territory. <strong>For evil geniuses
only.</strong><p align=center>

<blockquote>
"Nothing is more annoying to sophisticated people to see someone who is
rich enough to know better being tacky--unless it is to realize,
a moment later, that they probably know they are tacky and they
simply don't care and they are going to go on being tacky, and
rich, and happy, forever.<p>

...This is all strongly reminiscent of the heyday of Communism and
Socialism, when the bourgeoisie were hated from both ends: by the
proles, because they had all the money, and by the intelligentsia,
because of their tendency to spend it on lawn ornaments."

MGM will not get your whites whiter or your colors brighter.  It will,
however, sit there and look spiffy while sucking down a major
honking wad of RAM.<p>
