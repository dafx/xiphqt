<h2>Troubleshooting the beast...</h2>

MGM is aimed at skilled users, not the 3l33T3 warez crowd.<p>

(1f U sp3ll l1k3 th1s, gu3ss wh1ch U R)<p>

It's for those who know what an awful hack MGM is and just don't
care. MGM was originally a script for my use, but a few other folks
liked it so I'm just going to fling it at the world at large.  I'm not
going to let it become a support load. I'm not interested in teaching
newbies how to use X resources this time around, sorry.<p>

That said, there are a few things that are tricky about using MGM, so
I might as well save folks the time of slugging through misleading
problems and list a few of the things that can go wrong below.<p>

<h3>Weird Tk errors</h3>

It turns out Tk doesn't deal well with whitespace in X resources; it
considers whitespace to be part of the entry, ends up being unable to
look up colors like "Black ", and then just gives up. If you get
something like the below:

<pre>
Use of inherited AUTOLOAD for non-method Tk::MainWindow::_Destroyed() is 
deprecated at /usr/lib/perl5/Tk/MainWindow.pm line 55.
Use of uninitialized value at /usr/lib/perl5/Tk/MainWindow.pm line 55.
821b47c () is not a hash at /usr/lib/perl5/Tk/MainWindow.pm line 55.
Abort
</pre>

or

<pre>
Error eval()ing ->module_run for Netstat: unknown color name "gray      " 
at /usr/lib/perl5/Tk/Submethods.pm line 37.
</pre>

Chances are you have whitespace in your MGM resources.  Emacs in
font-lock mode has the tendancy to insert tabs where you least expect.
Check carefully for this.

MGM will not get your whites whiter or your colors brighter.  It will,
however, sit there and look spiffy while sucking down a major
honking wad of RAM.<p>
