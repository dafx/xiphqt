<h1>Module: phoon</h1>

phoon is essentially xphoon, rewritten in Perl with a few math
tweaks/fixes and different base case data.  It gives a graphical
display of the phase of the moon.<p>

<h2>Current platforms</h2>
All

<h2>Instances</h2>
multiple allowed

<h2>additional resources</h2>
ipad<p>

ipad specifies an internal padding to add to the inside of all four
module borders.  The padding is added inside any relief.<p>


<h2>Resource defaults</h2>

Resource defaults explicitly altered from the global defaults by this
module:

<ul>
<li>borderwidth: 1
<li>ipad: 20
<li>order: .2
<li>relief: sunken
<li>scalejustify: 0
<li>scalelenadj: 60
<li>scalerefresh: 2000
<li>scalewidadj: 150
</ul>

<h2>Possible enhancements</h2>

Oh boy, here we go...<p>

This is the kind of module one can take to a logical extreme... and I
really hope someone does! In addition to wishing the prediction
algorithm was more precise (the code I use is +/- 20 minutes for the
next several centuries, which is better than xphoon managed.  Emacs's
calender, however, is +/- a minute or so... and it *bugs* me), I'd
like phoon to predict blue/harvest moons and eclipses.  The biggest
single want, though, is to get the axial tilt and lighting right.  At
the moment it just does the easy stuff like xphoon.  I realize that
would require lon/lat, something difficult to autosense, but that's
what X resources are for :-)<p>

It would be especially cool for a real astronomy nut to do it... I
*know* I'm going to get something wrong if I haven't already.<p>

Also, while I'm at it... anyone want to write earth? :-)<p>

MGM will not get your whites whiter or your colors brighter.  It will,
however, sit there and look spiffy while sucking down a major
honking wad of RAM.<p>
