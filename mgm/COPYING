I, Monty Montgomery of Xiph.Org, author of and sole
contributor to MGM, hereby release all versions of the complete MGM
source to the public domain.

The little spinning fish icon is still a Xiph.Org common trademark
(albeit an old, obsolete version of it), but the bits now belong to
everyone with no strings attached.

Just please please please don't make me fix bugs in it.
