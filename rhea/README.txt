	Rhea, a fast Theora/Vorbis player created by Michael Scheerer.
	Rhea player (c) 2009 Michael Scheerer www.meviatronic.com

	Many thanks to
	Monty <monty@xiph.org> and
	The XIPHOPHORUS Company http://www.xiph.org/ .
	
	Rhea is intendend to be a pure Theora/Vorbis player without an underlying
	multimedia framework. Rhea can be integrated into a Java Sound API plugin,
	like the Vorbis plugin deployed from www.javazoom.net
	
	Currently only the audio part together with an audio player is ready.
	But it's still usable as a Java Sound API plugin for other open source projects like
	the one here: http://www.javazoom.net/vorbisspi/vorbisspi.html
