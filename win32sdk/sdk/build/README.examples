=======================================================================
The SDKHOME environment variable must be set to where the SDK is rooted,
including the "sdk" part of the path. 
e.g. "c:\src\xiph\sdk"

The sample programs in "SDKHOME\examples\vorbis"
can be built by using this build environment.

For an IDE build, the workspace "examples.dsw" can be loaded,
then from the "build" menu, the "build" menu item will build
all the example programs, both static and dynamic, debug and
release versions.

For a command line build, first run "mkmak.bat" to generate
the makefiles, them run "build_all.bat"

"run_tests.bat" will run each version, of each example program,
against test data.  The versions are debug-static, release-static,
debug DLL and release DLL.

"clean_all.bat" will run all the clean targets.
