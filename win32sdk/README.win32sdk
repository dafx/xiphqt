win32sdk Readme, 13 September, 2001 Chris Wolf
===========================================================================
This is the win32 SDK for Ogg/Vorbis

  This directory, "win32sdk", is not actually part of the SDK as such,
  but is a staging area for building the SDK.  The complete SDK ends
  up in a directory tree rooted in "sdk", under this directory.
  The "sdk" directory tree, once prepared should then be relocatable
  and usable by itself.

PREREQUSITES

  The SRCROOT environment variable must be set pointing to the 
  root directory where each of the cvs modules are rooted.  The
  cvs modules "ogg", "vorbis" and "win32sdk" (this module) are 
  required for this build.

QUICK SUMMARY

  1.) run makesdk.bat
  2.) cd sdk\build
  3.) run build_all.bat
  4.) run run_tests.bat


  If there are build problems, try the following three steps
  before performing the above mentioned four steps.

  1.) run clean_libs_mak.bat
  2.) run mkmak.bat
  3.) run clean_all.bat


BUILDING

  The following steps are optional. They are for building the libraries
  in place. The purpose of this step is for libaray development under
  win32.

  IDE build:

  Load the "all.dsw" workspace.  This workspace loads and manages the
  the dependent library project files.  To perform a build, from the "build"
  menu, select the "build" menu item.  This will build all the dependent
  libaries, but not copy them.


  N.B. Since unecessary MSVC ancillary files are not present upon initial
       checkout, e.g. *.ncb, I've seen MSVC get unhandled exceptions upon
       the first startup; subsequent sessions should then work.

       Unlike prior versions of MSVC, workspaces (*.dsw) are 
       used to manage groups of related projects.  There should never
       be a reason to directly open project files (*.dsp).  The 
       workspace keeps track of project dependencies and insures that
       each project is build in the correct order.  If you attempt to 
       open a project (*.dsp) file, then a corresponding workspace (*.dsw)
       will be created, which is fine, if you only have a single project,
       which is not the case with this module (win32sdk).  So the two
       worspaces that are relevant here, are "all.dsw" and 
       "sdk\build\examples.dsw"

       
INSTALLING

  Once prepared, the tree rooted in "sdk" can be used to build
  win32 applications based on Ogg/Vorbis.  See the README in 
  sdk\build for further information.
  
OTHER SCRIPTS

  clean_all.bat       - performs a make clean for each library target in
                        ogg and vorbis.
 
  clean_libs_mak.bat  - deletes the makefiles and their dependecy files
                        (*.mak, *.dep) in ogg and vorbis

  clean_dist.bat      - restores win32sdk to it's freshly checked out state,
 
  mkmak.bat           - creates makefiles and dependency files in the ogg and
                        vorbis modules.

  mfmacro.bat         - creates an MSVC macro used for makefile
                        generation from the command line.

  sdk\build\mkmak.bat - creates makefiles for the example programs
