*************************** REQUIREMENTS **************************

Linux RealPlayer 8 (for any available platform).

Perl 5 (for the Snatch Robot) with File::Glob, Tk8 and a couple of
other modules that are standard in most Perl installs.  File::Glob
didn't become included by default until Perl 5.6.0, so at least 5.6.0
is recommended.

A compiler, GCC heavily recommended.

*************************** COMPILATION ***************************

libsnatch has to be compiled.  It isn't actually worthy of a Makefile
at this point.

gcc -O2 -shared libsnatch.c -o libsnatch.so

All the dynamic libs libnatch needs are sucked in from RealPlayer.

The Snatch Robot need not be compiled as it's a Perl script.

*************************** INSTALLATION **************************

The only two important bits to install are libsnatch.so and the Snatch
Robot.  Installation consists of:

1) Put the Snatch Robot ('Snatch') wherever you want it.  Somewhere in
   the path is recommended.  /usr/local/bin/ usually does nicely.

2) Stick libsnatch.so where Snatch Robot can find it.  The places
   Snatch Robot searches by default are:
  
   /usr/local/lib/libsnatch.so
   /usr/lib/libsnatch.so	
   ~/snatch/libsnatch.so
   ~/.snatch/libsnatch.so

The Snatch Robot will need to find RealPlayer too.  If it's not in the
path, you can deal with that after starting Snatch.

***************************** EXAMPLES ****************************

To install Snatch in your home directory (doesn't need root)

tar -xvzf snatch-20011112.tgz
cd snatch-20011112
gcc -O2 -shared libsnatch.c -o libsnatch.so
mkdir ~/.snatch
mv libsnatch.so ~/.snatch
mv Snatch ~/

run Snatch with ~/Snatch

To install Snatch for the whole system (as root)

tar -xvzf snatch-20011112.tgz
cd snatch-20011112
gcc -O2 -shared libsnatch.c -o libsnatch.so
mv libsnatch.so /usr/lib/
mv Snatch /usr/bin/
