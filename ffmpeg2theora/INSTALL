Compiling from SVN
------------------
If you downloaded through SVN, you will not already have a ./configure 
script. You will need to build one.
You will need:
automake 1.6 or later
libtools
then run ./autogen.sh
Then build as you would from a tarball.


Compiling from tarball:
---------------------------------
you need
- the latest version of libtheora ( http://www.theora.org/files )
- ffmpeg-cvs ( http://ffmpeg.sf.net ) by running ./get_ffmpeg_cvs.sh
  (this script downloads current CVS ffmpeg, runs an appropriate
  configure and builds ffmpeg)

if you did not install ffmpeg but want to staticly link it
(recomended by ffmpeg developers) update PKG_CONFIG_PATH to
point to your ffmpeg source:

 export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/ffmpeg_src:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH

now you can build ffmpeg2theora:
./configure
make


Compiling on windows using mingw32:
---------------------------------
you have to compile libvorbis, libogg, libtheora
configure ffmpeg like this:
./configure --disable-encoder --enable-libogg --enable-vorbis --enable-theora \
 --enable-pp --enable-a52  --enable-gpl
