<h2>Troubleshooting the beast...</h2>

MGM is aimed at skilled users, not the 3l33T3 war3z crowd.<p>

(1f U sp3ll l1k3 th1s, gu3ss wh1ch U R)<p>

MGM was originally a script for my own use, but a few other folks
liked it (not unintended) so I'm just going to fling it at the world
at large.  I'm not going to let it become a support load. I'm not
interested in teaching newbies how to use X resources this time
around, sorry.<p>

That said, there are a few things that are tricky about using MGM, so
I might as well save folks the time of slugging through misleading
problems and list a few of the things that can go wrong below.<p>

<h3>Weird Tk errors</h3>

It turns out Tk doesn't deal well with whitespace in X resources; it
considers whitespace to be part of the entry, ends up being unable to
look up colors like "Black ", and then just gives up. If you get
something like the below:

<pre>
Use of inherited AUTOLOAD for non-method Tk::MainWindow::_Destroyed() is 
deprecated at /usr/lib/perl5/Tk/MainWindow.pm line 55.
Use of uninitialized value at /usr/lib/perl5/Tk/MainWindow.pm line 55.
821b47c () is not a hash at /usr/lib/perl5/Tk/MainWindow.pm line 55.
Abort
</pre>

or

<pre>
Error eval()ing ->module_run for Netstat: unknown color name "gray      " 
at /usr/lib/perl5/Tk/Submethods.pm line 37.
</pre>

Chances are you have whitespace in your MGM resources.  Emacs in
font-lock mode has the tendency to insert tabs where you least expect.
Check carefully for this.

<p>

<h3>It runs perfectly for a while then suddenly explodes</h3>

A few modules (diskuse and netstat for now) watch for changes in
machine configuration and will trigger an update of the whole MGM
window if, for example, a new filesystem appears in df.<p>

If you're riding the limits of minimum sizing, it's possible that the
window really needed to be bigger for the extra entry and instead the
world ended.  Similarly, forcably disabling automatic updates
(*reconfig: false) can cause things to break as MGM tries to monitor
devices that no longer exist.  Or, maybe you found a bug.  If you
did, drop us a line at <a href="mailto:mgm@xiph.org">mgm@xiph.org</a>.

MGM will not get your whites whiter or your colors brighter.  It will,
however, sit there and look spiffy while sucking down a major
honking wad of RAM.<p>
