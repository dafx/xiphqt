   <h1>Available input modules</h1>
   <table width="100%"><tr><td bgcolor="#007B79" height="10" align="center"></td></tr></table>
   <p>
    Several input modules are available, depending on the platform, drivers
    and libraries available. The general layout is defined as 
   </p>
   <pre>
    &lt;input&gt;
	&lt;module&gt;module name&lt;/module&gt;
	&lt;param name="name1"&gt;value&lt;/param&gt;
	&lt;param name="name2"&gt;value&lt;/param&gt;
	&lt;param name="name3"&gt;value&lt;/param&gt;
    &lt;/input&gt;
   </pre>
   <h2>Open Sound</h2>
   <pre>
	&lt;module&gt;oss&lt;/module&gt;
	&lt;param name="rate"&gt;44100&lt;/param&gt;
	&lt;param name="channels"&gt;2&lt;/param&gt;
	&lt;param name="device"&gt;/dev/dsp&lt;/param&gt;
	&lt;param name="metadata"&gt;1&lt;/param&gt;
	&lt;param name="metadatafilename"&gt;/home/ices/metadata&lt;/param&gt;
   </pre>
   <p>
    This module is for reading live input from the Open Sound System drivers,
    often found on linux systems but are available on others. This will read audio
    from the DSP device in a format specified in the parameters provided.
   </p>
   <p>
    The following can be used to configure the module
   </p>
   <h4>rate</h4>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    The value is in hertz, 44100 is the samplerate used on CD's, but some drivers
    may prefer 48000 (DAT) or you may want to use something lower.
   </div>
   <h4>channels</h4>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    The number of channels to record. This is typically 2 for stereo or 1 for mono
   </div>
   <h4>device</h4>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    The device to read the audio samples from, it's typically /dev/dsp but
    there maybe more than one card installed.
   </div>
   <h4>metadata</h4>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    Check for metadata arriving, if any are present then the data is marked
    for an update. The metadata is in the form of tag=value, and while Ogg
    Vorbis can handle any supplied tags, most players will only do anything
    with artist and title.
   </div>
   <h4>metadatafilename</h4>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    <p>
     The name of the file to open and read the metadata tags from, with this
     parameter missing standard input is read. Using a file is often the better
     approach. When using the file access the procedure is usually to populate
     the file contents then send a SIGUSR1 to the IceS process.
    </p>
    <p>
     The format of the file itself is a simple one comment per line format,
     below is a trivial example of the file, other tags can be used but players
     tend to only look for artist and title for displaying.
    </p>
   </div>
   <pre>
    artist=Queen
    title=We Will Rock You
   </pre>

   <h2>ALSA</h2>
   <p>
    The Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) is a completely different
    sound system on linux but provides OSS compatability so the OSS driver
    should work with it as well. To use ALSA natively a separate module is used
   </p>
   <pre>
	&lt;module&gt;alsa&lt;/module&gt;
	&lt;param name="rate"&gt;44100&lt;/param&gt;
	&lt;param name="channels"&gt;2&lt;/param&gt;
	&lt;param name="device"&gt;plughw:0,0&lt;/param&gt;
	&lt;param name="metadata"&gt;1&lt;/param&gt;
	&lt;param name="metadatafilename"&gt;/home/ices/metadata&lt;/param&gt;
   </pre>
   The parameters to ALSA are the same for OSS, as it performs the same task,
   ie captures audio from the DSP.

   <h2>Sun</h2>
   <p>
    The Sun Solaris DSP input is similar to OSS. It allows for reading from
    a soundcard on a Sun Solaris UNIX. OpenBSD also has a sound driver that
    is similar to solaris and as such should be able to use this module.
   </p>
   <pre>
        &lt;module&gt;sun&lt;/module&gt;
   </pre>
   <p>
    The parameters are the same as the OSS and ALSA modules.
   </p>
   <h2>StdinPCM</h2>
   <pre>
        &lt;module&gt;stdinpcm&lt;/module&gt;
        &lt;param name="rate"&gt;44100&lt;/param&gt;
        &lt;param name="channels"&gt;2&lt;/param&gt;
        &lt;param name="metadata"&gt;1&lt;/param&gt;
        &lt;param name="metadatafilename"&gt;/home/ices/metadata&lt;/param&gt;
   </pre>
   <p>
    This module should always be available, and as you can see the parameters
    are almost the same except for the device. The PCM audio comes from the
    standard input so it can be generated from some external app feeding into
    a pipe.
   </p>
   <p>
    As it's raw PCM being fed in, it's impossible to determine the samplerate
    and channels so make sure the stated parameters match the incoming PCM or
    the audio will be encoded wrongly.
   </p>
   <h2>Playlist</h2>
   <p>
    The playlist module is used to get audio from some pre-encoded Ogg
    Vorbis files. The method of file selection is determined by the playlist
    type.  The current types are basic and script.
   </p>

   <h3>Basic</h3>
   <pre>
    &lt;param name="type"&gt;basic&lt;/param&gt;
    &lt;param name="file"&gt;/path/to/playlist&lt;/param&gt;
    &lt;param name="random"&gt;0&lt;/param&gt;
    &lt;param name="once"&gt;0&lt;/param&gt;
    &lt;param name="restart-after-reread"&gt;1&lt;/param&gt;
   </pre>
   <h4>file</h4>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    State a path to a file which will contain a list of Ogg Vorbis filenames
    to play. One per line with lines beginning with '#' being treated as
    comments.  If a line has a single '-' then standard input is read, which
    provides a way of getting some external Ogg Vorbis stream into ices.
   </div>
   <h4>random</h4>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    When set to 1, the playlist will be randomised when the playlist is
    loaded. By default random is off
   </div>
   <h4>once</h4>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    When set to 1, the playlist is gone through once and then ends, this will
    cause ices to exit. By default once is off.
   </div>
   <h4>restart-after-reread</h4>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    If the playlist is re-read mid way through, which may occur if the
    playlist was updated then this will restart at the beginning of the
    playlist. By default it's off.
   </div>
   <h3>Script</h3>
   <pre>
        &lt;param name="type"&gt;basic&lt;/param&gt;
        &lt;param name="program"&gt;/path/to/program&lt;/param&gt;
   </pre>
   <h4>Program</h4>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    State a path to a program which when run will write to it's standard
    output a path to an Ogg Vorbis file. The program can be anything from
    an executable to a shell script as long as it starts, writes the
    filename to it's standard output and then exits.
