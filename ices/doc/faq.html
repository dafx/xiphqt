    This for those questions people have asked as it wasn't covered
    in the documentation

   <h4>Can ices play mp3 files</h4>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    <p>
     No, there hasn't been much interest in handling mp3 with ices2. The
     older version ices 0.3 maybe of interest in such cases.

   <h4>How do I encode from Line-In</h4>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    <p>
     IceS will read from the DSP on the soundcard, but where that gets the
     audio from depends on the mixer settings.  Use a utility like aumix to 
     see the settings and change the capture or recording device. Usually the
     default is the Mic

   <h4>When I start ices 2 it seems to get stuck not doing anything</h4>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    If you are using live input, check to see if something else is holding the
    recording device (typically /dev/dsp) open. A good candidate is esd. What
    happens is that the driver only allows one application to have the device
    open at any one time, a second attempt will just block.
   </div>
   <h4>Ices reports a message about failing to set samplerate on live input</h4>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    Some hardware/drivers are limited in the settings they support. Sometimes
    they only support one samplerate like 48khz. You have to experiment if the
    documentation for the device is not specific.
