   <p>
    This for those questions people have asked as it wasn't covered
    in the documentation
   </p>
   <h4>Can ices play mp3 files</h4>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    <p>
     No, there hasn't been much interest in handling mp3 with ices2. The
     older version ices 0.3 maybe of interest in such cases.
    </p>
   </div>
   <h4>How do I encode from Line-In</h4>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    <p>
     IceS will read from the DSP on the soundcard, but where that gets the
     audio from depends on the mixer settings.  Use a utility like aumix to 
     see the settings and change the capture or recording device. Usually the
     default is the Mic
    <p>
   </div>
   <h4>When I start ices 2 it seems to get stuck not doing anything</h4>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    If you are using live input, check to see if something else is holding the
    recording device (typically /dev/dsp) open. A good candidate is esd. What
    happens is that the driver only allows one application to have the device
    open at any one time, a second attempt will just block.
   </div>
   <h4>Ices reports a message about failing to set samplerate on live input</h4>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    Some hardware/drivers are limited in the settings they support. Sometimes
    they only support one samplerate like 48khz. You have to experiment if the
    documentation for the device is not specific.
   </div>
   <h4>The sound quality is poor</h4>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    <p>
     Ogg Vorbis is a lossy compression technology, so quality of the sound is
     reduced, however with live input the source of audio can be poor depending
     on the soundcard and the system it's in.  As an initial test just record
     a wav file from the DSP (using eg rec, arecord etc) and listen to the
     quality of the audio recorded.  If the source of audio is poor then encoding
     it to Ogg Vorbis is not going to improve it.
    </p>
    <p>
     The reasons for poor audio from the DSP can be difficult to resolve, search
     for information on audio quality.  It could be driver related or maybe some
     interference from some other device.
