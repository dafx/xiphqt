This is ices 2.0

It's the primary source client for icecast 2.0.

This is the first beta release of ices 2.0. It's fairly stable and well-
featured, but some configurations may cause problems.

Documentation is not yet done, so you'll have to rely on the example config
files for help for now.

To build and install, run
    ./configure
    make
    make install

You WILL need to edit the config file you choose to use before running this.

For help, email us at icecast@xiph.org, icecast-dev@xiph.org, or find us
on IRC at irc.xiph.org, in #icecast or #vorbis.
