USAGE

Libao is currently a dynamically-linked library.  This means if you
want to use it, you have to rewrite your program to use the libao API
and link libao to your programs.

If you are using autoconf and automake, include the ao.m4 project in
your project (acinclude.m4 is the usual place) and call

AM_PATH_AO(minimum-required-version, action-if-found, action-if-not-found)

in your configure.in.  Please look at the ogg123 project for an example
of how this works.

If you do not use autoconf, you need to link against libao and use
ao-config to figure out where the libs and headers are on your 
machine.

Finally, you need to modify your program to use the libao API.
