Requirements *************

Perl 5 with the Tk module installed

Installation *************

1) Untar MGM where you want it to actually be installed.
/usr/local/mgm is a very good place.

2) Make a symlink from (for example) /usr/local/bin to the absolute
path of the actual MGM script.  The symlink must point to the *full*
*absolute* path.  The install relies on this.  In our example, with
MGM installed in /usr/local/mgm:

ln -s /usr/local/mgm/mgm /usr/local/bin/mgm

...will do nicely.

All done.  Don't forget to rehash any csh derivative shells.

copy of the HTML documents, current as of this version of MGM, are
also in the mgm/doc directory.
