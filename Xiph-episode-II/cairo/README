These C files are quick little Cairo applications used to generate
images for the various animations in the Xiph Episode II video
"Digital Show & Tell".  Each one generates a series of PNG images that
are then stitched togetehr into an animation using a utility like
ffmpeg or mplayer, or an editor like Cinelerra.

Compile each with the commandline:

gcc inname.c -o outname -lm -lcairo -lfftw3f

ch4-samplequant.c also requires the 'squishyio' library from Xiph.org
SVN and the commandline:

gcc ch4-samplequant.c -o ch4-samplequant -lm -lcairo -lfftw3f -lsquishyio
