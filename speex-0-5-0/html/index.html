             <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/speex">The Speex project</a>
          aims  to build an open-source (LGPL) <A href="patents.html">patent-free</A> voice codec. Unlike 
  other codecs   like  MP3 and <a href="http://www.vorbis.org/">Ogg Vorbis</a>, Speex is specially   designed for compressing voice at low bit-rates
 for  applications such as  voice over IP (VoIP). In some sense, it is meant 
 to  be complementary to the  Ogg Vorbis codec.             
<p>If you are interested in participating to the project, contact us at <a href="mailto:speex-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">
           speex-devel@lists.sourceforge.net</a>  or <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/speex-devel">
           join  our mailing list</a>. Right now, we are mostly looking for 
 developers with signal processing and speech coding knowledge, as well 
 as people with knowledge about patents in that field. See the 
<A href="http://sourceforge.net/pm/task.php?group_project_id=19556&group_id=46651&func=browse">task list</A> for more details about what's left to do in Speex<br>

<h2>News</h2>

<h3>2002/06/12</h3>

Speex 0.3.0 has been released. There is now a new "low bit-rate" narrowband mode for coding speech at 8 kbps. There's also support for big-endian machines (untested, please report bugs). Speex files now have real header containing information like bit-stream version (revents from playing an incompatible bit-stream), sampling rate, bit-rate and user comments. On the quality side, the post-filter has been improved and there has been more codebook optimization. Note that this release breaks bit-stream compatibility with previous releases. 

<h3>2002/06/07</h3>

Speex 0.2.0 is out. This is a major release with lots of improvements and bugfixes. First, the 
encoder and decoder can work directly from wav files (mono only for now) and 
the decoder can play directly to soundcard. Also, most of the codebooks have 
been re-trained in order to improve quality (but this also breaks format 
compatibility with previous versions), while slightly decreasing complexity. 
Speex is now able to encode both DTMF and music (not as good as Vorbis of 
course) after bugs were fixed in the pitch prediction and LSP quantization. 
Last but not the least, the perceptual post-filter has been improved.

<h3>2002/06/04</h3>

Speex 0.1.2 is out. This adds a perceptual post-filter at the decoder to 
(hopefully) increase quality. It can be enabled with the --pf option to 
speexdec. The Speex format remains the same for both narrowband 
and wideband.

<h3>2002/05/15</h3>

Speex 0.1.0 has been released. Speex now uses the Ogg bitstream (using libogg). That means that
there is now (limited) bitstream error recovery. Also, the narrowband bit-rate has been reduced
from 15.7 kbps to 15.1 kbps and the wideband bit-rate has been reduced from 31.3 kbps to 27.7 kbps.
The quality remains roughly the same for both narrowband and wideband.
Once again, this breaks compatibility with previous versions.
