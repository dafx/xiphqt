	Cronus is intendend to be the successor of the Cortado Theora/Vorbis player
	and predecessor of the Zeus player.
	The base of Cronus is the Jst (Java port of GStreamer 0.10) multimedia framework
	developed from Wim Taymans and new Theora/Vorbis/Comment decoders.
	
	Advantages of Cronus over the current Cortado player:
	- better decoders with better performance.
 	- much lower memory consumption:
 	 100 Mbyte instead of 140 Mbyte after playing 10 minutes
 	 of a 640 * 320 Theora video (BigBugBunny.ogv).
