oggplay todo
------------

The general idea is for the to be testbed for multiplexed ogg 
playback. Probably we'll try out ideas that may help with or
become part of OggFile.

Goals in no special order:

 * the code sucks, rewrite it
 * switch to a modular stucture like oggmerge, only cleaner
 * add support for theora video
 * add support for mng overlays on other video
 * add support for midi
 * sync to audio playback or an external clock
