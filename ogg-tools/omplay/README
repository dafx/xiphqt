This is omplay, the Ogg MIDI player.  It plays files that contain
MIDI and Vorbis substreams (in either order).  The files are played
synchronized.  It supports pause, stop and fast-forward via status files.

This player is dependent on ALSA (0.9.x+).  Currently this code will only
work with CVS versions of ALSA with a few patches.  Hopefully these
patches will become part of the stock ALSA.

The patches are included in alsa-cvs.patch. 

A test file test.ogg is included which contains test tones in both MIDI and
in Vorbis as well as short musical passages.
