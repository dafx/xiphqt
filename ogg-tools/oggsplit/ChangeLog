oggsplit (0.1.1)
  * moved all output filename calculation to one place and tidied it up.
  * changed how the output filenames are calculated. Now any suffix of
    length 4 or less is stripped out and used (might be good for .spx).
  * output files are now placed in CWD by default, instead of the same dir
    as input files.
  * changed source files and docs (not the man page) to use UTF-8 encoding.
  * removed use of autoproject's system.h and xmalloc.c

oggsplit (0.1.0)
  * initial version.
