Description: splits multiplexed Ogg files
 oggsplit can split grouped or chained multiplexed Ogg
 files into separate files. It's useful for separating
 the video and audio in a theora+vorbis file or splitting
 two concatenated ogg files. oggsplit does not care about
 stream formats and thus works with any type of stream.
