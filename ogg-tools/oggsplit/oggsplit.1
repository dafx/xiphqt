.SH NAME
oggsplit \- splits multiplexed Ogg files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B oggsplit
[
.B -cgVh
]
[
.B -o
.I <directory>
]
.I input_files \fR...

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBoggsplit\fP splits multiplexed Ogg files into separate files. Both grouped
and chained logical streams are are supported.
.PP
Grouping (concurrent multiplexing) is when two streams run alongside in the
file, as is the case in a theora+vorbis Ogg file. Chaining (sequential
multiplexing) is when complete physical bitstreams are strung one after the
other. Such a file is created by simply joining two complete files with
\fBcat(1)\fP or a similar tool.
.PP
By default \fBoggsplit\fP extracts all streams, chained as well as grouped.
Since \fBoggsplit\fP does not care about about stream formats and thus works
with any type of stream. For the same reason, it cannot split the file at an
arbitrary point. For such functionality, use a specialized tool like
\fBvcut(1)\fP.

.SH OPTIONS
\fBoggsplit\fP accepts the following options:
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-unchain
Only split chained streams.
.TP
.B \-g, \-\-ungroup
Only split grouped streams. This  will cause only the first link to be
processed, and the names of the output files will be slightly simpler.
.TP
.BI "-o, --outdir " "<directory>"
Create all output files in the specified directory.
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
Show oggsplit version.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Show summary of options.
