\section{ Introduction }

Hi, this is some preliminary documentation to the tarkin/w3d code. It's written
to document the code, explain and discuss the used algorithms and help those 
ones who want to read or modify the code.

It's neither complete nor written to learn everything about compression 
algorithms. If you want more general introductions to data compressions please 
take a look in the Bibliography to find some pointers.

The first section will give a brief overview over the compression codec.
Then all parts of the encoder/decoder will be described in the order they appear
in the encoder. Have fun !


\section{ Overview }

Almost all steps in the compression codec try to transform data into a 
representation with a few large numbers and many smaller ones which need
less bits to encode and can be compressed well by entropy coders.

An RGB image is first transformed into a YUV-alike colorspace to decorrelate in
color direction, U and V are usually much smaller than the RGB components.
Y is a weighted average of the red, green and blue color component.

Then each color component is then transformed into frequency space using a 
lifting integer wavelet transform. This is again decorrelating, this time in 
image space direction. Our wavelet transform implementation can handle 1D-, 
2D- and 3D-data. The resulting coefficients are then quantized and entropy 
coded, these areas still need a lot of work, thus they are not yet documented.
