\section{ The Coefficient Quantizer }

I'll describe this as soon it works \dots

The relevant code is in \verb|wavelet.c|.
For now only this: we don't quantize the coefficients explizitly but transmit
them bitplane-by-bitplane (significand and insignificand bits in different 
bitstreams, thus two streams per bitplane).

When you don't transmit the entire bitstream you quantize and threshold the 
coefficients implicitly by cutting away insignificand bits and small 
coefficients.
