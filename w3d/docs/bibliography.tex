\bibitem{opticalflow}
J.L. Barron, D.J. Fleet, S.S. Beauchemin,
"Performance of Optical Flow Techniques",
A really good introduction how to determine the motion flow in image sequences;
it compares different approaches and algorithms. Online available as

"The Z-Coder Adaptive Binary Coder",
(a fast and effective binary entropy coder; paper is available on AT\&T's 
DjVu homepage \verb|djvu.att.com|. We won't use this because of unresolved
patent issues but nevertheless it's a nice and fast algorithm)
