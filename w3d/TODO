Open bugs and stuff required to fix them:

 - a bug in the yuv<->rgb24conversion, shows up in the clouds sequence
 - clean up the pnsr tools


Wavelet-related TODO's:

 - oggetize the stream format
 - improve truncation table setup, the current code is pretty dumb
 - try other approaches to encode coefficients, jack was talking about VQ
    and reuse vorbis code
 - write avitotarkin/quicktimetotarkin/mpegtotarkin/player/recorder
    (a libsndfile/libaudiofile alike video library would be great !)
 - profile
 - add special transform functions for large strides to prevent cache misses
 - mmx/3dnow/sse/altivec


Other:

 - think about a multiresolution multidimensional motion detection scheme
 - the wavelet codec could be used for still image compression too
    (we just have to define a file format with all goodies you can imagine;) 
 - to make it perfect someone has to write a good bilevel compressor and
    mask seperation algorithm
