 - design file/stream format and find a cool name for this codec
 - write avitow3d/quicktimetow3d/player/recorder (a libsndfile/libaudiofile alike video library would be great !)
 - tune coefficient transmission order in coder.c
 - (4,4) - Wavelets
 - arithmetic binary entropy coders may be faster, simpler and more efficient
 - profile
 - rewrite wavelet xform code, the current implementation forces cache misses
 - skip first empty bitplanes, we could save a per-level min/max value
 - introduce fast paths in coefficient decoder if (mps == 0)
 - mmx/3dnow/sse/altivec
